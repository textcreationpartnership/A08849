            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The commaundement heereof, was not burdenous or vnreaſonable for man to beare: but only reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therein due obedience and loue towardes his louing God and maker: vnto whome only, that noble creature man (aboue all other creatures) ſhould haue had moſt ſpeciall regarde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering moſte déepely in him ſelfe the excellencie of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, that ſo graciouſly formed him, bleſſed him, and moſte plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly placed him: and there to looke for al goodneſſe only at his holy hand: &amp; not to take as it were vpon him ſelfe by his owne woorthyneſſe, the forme of goodneſſe and euill: but ſhould onely haue holden that for euil and forbidden, which God reſtrained as euill, and to count that only for good and rightuous, which of God is allowed, and graunted. God therefore toke Adam, and to put him out of all doutes, brought him to the ſame place, and ſhewed him the very trée and the frute therof, ſtanding in the middeſt of the Garden of pleaſure, and forbad him the eating thereof with an earneſt charge and threatning, ſaying on this wiſe vnto him: In what ſo euer houre thou ſhalt eate the frute of that trée, thou ſhalt ſurely die, &amp; be ſubiect to eternall deathe. Yet notwithſtanding this ſtraighte reſtrainte of God, Adam ſtackered, and dealt but ſlipperly, vntruely, and careleſly, with his faithful God and maker, tranſgreſſing his holy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and gaue more credit to the perſuaſion of the woman and of the wicked ſerpent, than to the truthe of Gods woorde and his holy commaundement. Whiche was nothing elſe but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much as in them did lie, to take vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the form of good and euil as out of them ſelues, or by ſome other meane, rather than of God their maker: vnto whoſe only wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they ſhould moſt humbly haue yéelded their obedience: as vnto him, who alwayes moſt gratiouſly wiſheth all goodneſſe vnto euery man. For he being by the woman and the ſerpent deceiued, thought that God was not indifferent towards him, but that be had rather of ſette purpoſe, withdrawne from him, ſome parcell of his diuine and godly wiſedome. Therefore, for
<pb facs="tcp:26975:7"/> as muche as in mind he was thus deceiued, ſodenly chaunged, and departed now from God, declaring thereby his vnſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, infidelitie, and vnfaythfulneſſe: and looked not for all good things only at his gracious hands, as of duetie he ſhould, but yelded to the Diuell, receiued that was offered, and taſted to his condemnation of that ſtrayt forbidden fruite, to aduance and ſet forwardes him ſelfe, to the preſence and ſecrete high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods mightie maieſtie: and that rather by ſome bye way with his owne will and conſente, then contenting him ſelfe with the onely will of God: and ſo to recouer thereby as he thought, the fulneſſe of his neceſſitie and lacke of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: which he then imagined to be muche wanting in him ſelfe. And thus with his forgetfulneſſe, haughtineſſe of heart, infidelitie, ſlipperines, diſobedience &amp; vnthankfulneſſe againſt his God and Maker (and deſerued therby his iuſt vengeance, and to be for euer the fyrebrande of hell, euer burning, euer dying, and neuer to dye the ſeconde death) he yet faſtened vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon life, which he moſte happily receiued, through the onely compaſſion and great mercy of God: who notwithſtanding, offence ſo gréeuouſly committed agaynſt him, wherby eternall damnation was due to the offendour, and to become a bonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue vnto the Diuell for euer, to whom he ſo willingly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo diligently obeyed beléeued, folowed, and ſerued: yet (as is ſayde) ſo great and vnſpeakable was the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, ſo infinitely his loue abounded, and ſo tender he was ouer him, and ſo ſorowfull for his gréeuous fall from bliſſe, into perdurable tormente and paine, and to redeeme him agayne from it, and from the diuell: that he moſte certaynely decréed with him ſelfe to curſe his owne deare ſonne, and to puſhe him as it were forwards by the ſhoulders, to moſt cruel death for the recouering agayne of man: And ſo through his ſonnes moſte paynefull death and paſſion, to ſaue mankinde from euerlaſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ath and damnation, which Adam himſelfe and his whole poſteritie fell into, through the infection of his pride, diſobedience, and looſeneſſe of heart agaynſt God. Euen here verily (as ye perceiue) had the iuſte God iuſte occaſion by iuſtice, iuſtly to expell man, to confounde him, to damne
<pb facs="tcp:26975:8"/> him, and to leaue him vtterly deſtitute of his grace, and to yéelde him to the Diuell for euer: for ſo did his righteouſneſſe and truthe require. Conſider, theſe were the wordes that God ſpake vnto him: I tell thée Adam, in what ſoeuer houre thou eateſt of the fruite, thou ſhalt ſurely dye the death. How beit, the great goodneſſe and mercy that was in God, called him backe from moſte ſeuere iuſtice, and required not vtter reuengemente, and thereby to ſuppreſſe man, a very frayle, poore, and naked creature. In the meane tyme therfore, God found out the very true and ready way, whereby his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe &amp; truth might fully to effect be ſatiſfied, and wherein alſo the ſwéeteneſſe of his mercy ſhoulde ſpecially be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and declare foorth the mightineſſe of it ſelfe: that is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay, the onely Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chryſt: which (as I ſayde before) was willingly puſhed vnto deathe, to deliuer Adam and his whole poſteritie from their ſinne and damnation, through the onely fauour and mercies ſake of God the eternall father. Therefore bicauſe mankinde coulde in no wyſe be ſaued and deliuered fréely from ſinne, death, and the Diuell, and ſo made agayne at one with his ſo louing and faythfull a God, as he ſhewed hym ſelfe vnto Adam his firſte creature, but onely by Chryſt Ieſus hys owne and onely Sonne: Chryſt dyd moſte willingly ioyne in conſente with his father, and ſo tooke vppon him ſelfe the rigour of his fathers terrible ſentence, pronounced iuſtely agaynſt Adam, &amp; the curſe of the whole lawe vpon his owne backe, and dyed Adams due death, for him and for vs all, that were by him in the lyke ſtate of damnation. For euen ſo ſayth the Prophete: Curſed is he that hangeth on trée. Wée be now therefore redéemed agayne by Chryſtes death, from our bondage, and from the ſeruyce and ſlauerie of the Diuel, and from that moſt bitter curſe, that was proper vnto Adam and to all his ofſpring. Wée are alſo by Chryſt, taken out of the kingdome of darkneſſe, and placed through his onely deſerte in the cleare lighte, and in the moſte glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe kingdome of our eternall and louing God. In thys maner paſſing now further on my purpoſe, the gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:26975:8"/> ſhall take the ſpeciall meaning of the holy Apoſtle in his Epiſtle on thys wyſe: whyche is, that all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men muſte wholly depende vppon the mercy of God, throughe hys deare Sonne Ieſus Chryſt, for the fulneſſe of their eternall redemption, and by hys onely merites to attayne their eternall ſaluation. And that all ſuche, as looke to come vnto it by their owne merites, deſeruings, and woorkinges, are in that poynte lyke vnto their father Adam: whiche, in hys pride and diſobedience, went about to come to the Maieſtie of God, through his owne deuiſes, vayne byewayes, and very fonde attemptes, at what tyme he moſte vnlawefully yéelded to eate the fruite, that was moſte lawfully of God forbidden him. All which proud attempters, may be wel aſſured to abide alſo the like curſſe that was giuen to Adam, but not a bleſſing, or the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that of God was mercyfully promyſed, and that onely by the merytes of Ieſus Chryſt: onleſſe they will beginne to repente of their pride, blindeneſſe and diſobedience, and onely referre it to our mercyfull God him ſelfe, throughe the onely faythe and beléefe due from them to our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte: who onely ſatiſfieth the truthe and iuſtice of GOD in thys poynte, whiche ſayde vnto Adam: In what ſo euer houre thou eateſt of the fruyte, thou ſhalte ſurely dye the death. By which onely ſatiſfaction of Chryſt, all men (euen as Adam) bée reconciled agayne vnto God the father, their ſinnes fréely remytted, and come boldely agayne to the preſence of hys maieſtie, and not by our owne deuiſes and fooliſhe inuentions, as (the more pitie it is) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men moſte blindly doo, that beareth at this day the names of Chryſtians. Wherefore, in as muche as it was then concluded, that Chryſt was the very perfecte waye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore man agayne to his perfect ioy and felicitie, which before he had loſte: It was thought of God almightie méete and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſende vnto him a lawe before the comming of the ſauiour Chryſt: which might put him daily in mynde of his fall from the ioyes, wherein God had once moſte happily placed hym, as alſo to lay playne open before his face his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
<pb facs="tcp:26975:9"/> pride, diſobedience and wretched liuing. For which cauſe, many hundreth yeres after the fall of Adam, was thys Lawe proclaymed by the Patriarke Moyſes, written and ſet foorth in Tables and Bookes: to the ende that by the ſtrayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, all men mighte knowe, not onely the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God ouer them, but alſo their owne naughtie nature, weakeneſſe, blyndeneſſe, and myſerable ſtate through their diſobedience and ſinne: which before the Lawe came, hadde welnighe forgotten their deadly fall, and knew not in effecte what ſinne was, they were ſo wretchedly blinded in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their pride and falſe imaginations. To the ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all creatures ſhould know their owne caſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, their damnable ſtate and condition, the laws was proclaymed: which, beſides that it manyfeſted vnto vs the wonderfull mercy of God towards vs, as alſo the ſtate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam our firſt parent, and the filthyneſſe of all our ſinfull and abhominable liuing, and the giuing furthermore vnto vs ſuch precepts and commaundements of vertuous conuerſation and liuing, as alwayes is ſéemely for godly men to vſe: by the which, all men at all times ſhould haue rectified and amended their vngodly liues. It alſo preſcribed certayne Ceremonies, which men dayly exerciſe among them ſelues: taking the ſame, and ſtedfaſtely alſo beléeuing, that they dyd but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate the deathe of the ſame Chryſt, which was promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to dye the deathe, in the behalfe of Adam and his whole paſteritie: wherein, if men in tymes paſſed dyd vſe among them ſelues, according to this ſenſe and meaning, they were founde righteous before God: not for dooing the Ceremonies, but onely for their beléefes ſake, which they conceyued in Chryſt to come: whom onely the Ceremonies dyd but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefigurate.</p>

Wherfore, God now at this time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing elſe at our handes, but to haue alwayes reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnto his mercy thorow Ieſus Chriſt, and to beholde alſo his wonderfull loue towardes vs: to the ende we ſhould be aſhamed of our owne ſinfull actes, how ofte ſo euer we turne our mindes from him, through the committing of vice, which is diſpleaſant, abhominable, &amp; alwayes damnable in his ſight. Alſo, howe that we ſhould meekely acknowledge and confeſſe daily vnto him, our owne ſinnefull liues, the miſerableneſſe of our nature, &amp; how of our ſelues we are not able, to thinke, ſpeake, nor do any good thing: and not ſtubbernly to do as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam did, run from the face of God, hide our ſinnes from him, or elſe couer them from his preſence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our own vaine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For Adam, at what time he knewe that he had offended and broken his commaundement, he perceiued immediately what ſtate he ſtoode in, and by the accuſation of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he felte in him ſelfe the pricke of ſinne, he began then to be trudging, and to hide him ſelfe from him, and ſoughte meanes to couer him ſelfe, althoughe with moſte ſimple and very ſlender clothing, which he then accordingly but litle tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto like as it is all vnprofitable that man of hys owne braine wil deuiſe to cloke his ſinne with all, although both he and his make flie neuer ſo faſt from the face of the Lord, and ſeeke meanes to hide them ſelues. But yet notwithſtanding all this ſaide diſobedience, hautie, and proude ſtubberneſſe of Adam: which after he had moſt wretchedly offended, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hide him ſelf from God, than meekely to acknowledge his fault before him: the louing Lord was ſtricken ſo full of compaſſion and mercy towards man, his ſimple, naked, and poore creature, that he quickely folowed, and haſtened him ſelf after that fugitiue and runnagate found him quickly but, conferred moſt mildly with him, put him in minde of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, great myſerie, and the happie life that he miſerably had falne from, and ſaide on this wiſe to him: Adam where arte
<pb facs="tcp:26975:10"/> thou? which ſhould ſignifie vnto him: O Adam, knoweſt thou what thou haſt done? haſt thou conſidered wel with thy ſelf of thy preſent ſtate, and what miſerie thou art now falne into fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine innocencie, bliſſefull ſtate and felicitie, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of my wil and commaundement? At theſe wordes now ſhould Adam haue bene abaſhed, quickned to memorie, ſtirred to trembling, earneſtly moued to méekeneſſe and obedience, and reuerently at the foote of his maker, to acknowledge &amp; confeſſe his fault, to crie <hi>peccaui,</hi> and to aſk for mercy. But he contrariwiſe ſhewed him ſelfe ſtoute and ſtiffe necked. And the louing Lord yet ſtill applied him, and moued him with theſe words folowing, which ſhould haue pierced euen throughe the very harte of man, if he would haue ſhewed him ſelfe tractable and gentle, rather than proud and ſtubburn, and ſaid vnto him: O Adam, who told thée now that thou art naked? In which few words, priuie &amp; mighty checke, although it were moſt mildely and gently vttred of the Lord (bicauſe he wold not vtterly diſcorage the pore creature, in whoſe face he only behelde his owne ſimilitude:) yet the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcrete and very forgetful Adam of the great benefits of God, and his owne happy ſtate, ſhoulde foorthwith haue called to his remembrance, the great goodneſſe of his mercifull maker, and the miſerable eſtate that he was then preſently come vnto. But Adam would yet minde no ſuch thing at all, but ſtoode (as he thought in his owne fight,) very well and in good plighte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yet naked, or moſt ſlenderly ſhrouded with a fewe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leaues, to couer his miſery and filthy apparant nakedneſſe. Then the Lorde to helpe him yet further in this matter, and to pricke him forwardes to the confeſſion of his ſinne, ſaid on this wiſe: Tell me Adam: Haſte thou not in déede eaten of the trée, wherof I earneſtly forbad thée, and charged thée vpon a ſharpe penaltie that thou ſhouldeſt not eate thereof? But yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, man was loth to acknowledge his ſinne, and for a further excuſe or delay therin, he put the blame in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the woman. And the ſame did he with vnaduiſed and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward words: wherby, euery man may eaſily ſée, that ſecretely in his corrupted hart, he laide the fault moſt wickedly vpon the maieſtie of God him ſelfe. For he ſayde not thus ſimply vnto
<pb facs="tcp:26975:10"/> the Lord: The woman gaue me of the trée to eate: but proudly he added thereunto: The woman which thou gaueſt vnto me. As though he wold haue ſaide: thou thy ſelfe art faultie of this euill: for if thou haddeſt not giuen vnto me this woman, I had not bene thus deceiued, nor broken in this wiſe thy foreſayde commaundement. And yet (vnderſtand yée) the rightuous God gaue him not the woman to deceiue him, but to be vnto him an helper. Wherfore, it is now ſo much the more plain &amp; euident, that the ſin of man was the more hainous, apparantly wilful &amp; greuous. By which this notable hiſtorie of the fal of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly taught vnto al chriſten men, how mighty, great and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the mercy of god was towards vs of his part, as alſo what louing inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he giueth hereby vnto vs: that we ſhuld ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more méekely and humbly thanke him, &amp; alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge before him, our moſt ſinful &amp; abhominable ſtate of life. And euen ſo ſhall all we receiue in time, the iuſt reward of méekneſſe and true obedience towards God, through his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: by whoſe only death, merites and deſeruings, we be al brought to true health and ſaluation, and not by any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that commeth of oure ſelues: for the power of oure owne woorkes can no more further vs vnto our heauenly felicitie to come, than did the works of Adam, when he proudly did eat the apple, to the ende he might therby haue brought him ſelfe vnto the high maieſtie and preſence of God: but they do rather make our caſe damnable in his ſight, if we haue any confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce eyther in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in any thing elſe, ſaue only in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: from whence only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all felicitie, eternall ioy &amp; ſaluation. For to ſpeake moſte truely and vnfainedly in this matter: the worthineſſe of our works can no more couer or hide our ſinnes from the diſpleſure of the iuſt God, than did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid leaues couer Adam from the preſence of his Deitie. Therfore we muſt thus truly count of our ſelues to be nothing elſe, but ſinfull, blinde, ſtubburn &amp; diſobedient wretches: and for the only mercies ſake of God (in Ieſus Chriſt, we be al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of ſaluation, if we do truely beléeue in him. Furthermore, to helpe the Reader in this ſaid Epiſtle, I wil touch yet one thing moſt worthy of him to be noted: that is, like as the ſtubborneſſe of Adam in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, wold haue laid the ground of his offence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god himſelfe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſedome of God, that when the Iewes did forſake their owne profeſſion, and denyed the ſauioure Chriſte, that came to ſaue them and all mankinde, according to his fathers truth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſame law of Moſes, and the frute of Chriſtes comming, ſhould be turned vnto the Gentiles, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation. Howe be it, this benefite of God, is not ſo to be taken, as though he had nowe broken promiſſe with the Iewes, or that they ſhuld vtterly be depriued of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and goodneſſe: but that they may all haue, the profitte and commoditie therof as wel as the Gentiles, if they wil forſake in time their pride, malice and ſtoutneſſe, and ſubmit humbly them ſelues to the true faithe in Ieſus Chriſte. And whereas Paule ſpeaketh againſt the truſt that the Iewes haue in their law and circumciſion: he meaneth vnder the ſame, all kindes of Ceremonies and cuſtomes of religion, as yet be nowe vſed among Chriſten men.

But as God him ſelfe cannot be deceiued: ſo is it alſo farre from him, to be a deceiuer of other: although euery man may be a deceiuer, and he him ſelfe alſo deceiued. The Prophet Dauid doeth aſſure all men, in the certitude of Gods promiſes, which ſayeth: Thou Lord ſhalt appeare iuſt and true,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 115.

Vndoubtedly, many in their blindneſſe, do not diſcerne the true kéeping of Gods promiſſes with them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, through their owne very faulte and corruption, Gods veritie and truthe is made muche more manifeſt and commendable amongſt men. All which, ſhall (in time) well ſée, that God, notwithſtanding the great offences done daily
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26975:21"/> againſt him, will not alter nor chaunge the conſtancie and ſure determination of his full fixed minde and ſentence. And héere I am nowe ſure, that ſome buſte headed body, will ſtep foorthe his foote, and ſay: If the iuſtice then and truth of God, be made more manifeſt and commendable, through the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and faultie dooings of men: then God is vniuſt him ſelf, which will that ſinne ſhould be amongeſt men, to the ende his iuſtice ſhuld be the better apparant and knowne to men. But God forbid that any ſuche thought ſhoulde enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mannes heart. Alſo vngodlily they will ſay: howe ſhould God be the righfull iudge of this worlde, if he be vniuſt him ſelfe? For if it be prouided of God that I be a lier, to the ende, that through my lie, his veritie ſhoulde be made more renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and my ſhame redounde to his honoure and glory: then, why ſhoulde I haue my ſinne laide to my charge? Or why ſhoulde not all men thinke rather within them ſelues, and interpretate this place (as ſome certaine ſlanderous felowes ſay:) Let vs doe things that be euill, that the rather by their euill appearance, good things may happely come, in as much as by oure ſinne and vnrightuouſneſſe, the rightuouſneſſe of God is made more excellent? But God defend all men from ſuche curious Queſtions, vaine cogitations and wycked thoughtes. For all theſe by the iuſtice of God, in their owne pride and vanitie, be woorthily damned, for ſuche their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte, hatred, incredulitie and vnfaithfulneſſe: all which, as they can not lay to Gods charge, the cauſe that they thus doe ſinne, (which in déede commeth onely of them ſelues) euen ſo they ſhall haue no mercie nor grace ſhewed vnto them, althoughe their naughtineſſe and ſinne, be openly tourned into the publike ſhewe of hys onely prayſe and glorye.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26975:24"/> And let this which I now ſay be taken to none effect, onleſſe the holy Scriptures do truely approue the ſame. For thus ye ſhall read in the Booke of Geneſis the .xv. Chapter. Abraham beléeued in God,<note place="margin">Gene. 15. Gala. 3. Iaco. 2.</note> and his beléefe was imputed vnto him for his iuſtification. God promiſed him, that his poſteritie ſhould bée in number equall to the ſtarres of heauen, at ſuche tyme as his wife was barren and had no childe. Yet for all that he doubting nothing at all, truſted to the promiſe of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God. Neither marked he what it was that was promiſed vnto him, but who was the promiſer therof; and ſo forthwith he was reputed righteous, not by Circumciſion (at whiche time he had not receiued it) but by his onely faith, which was not teſtified of men, but of God him ſelfe, with whom onely Abraham wrought this myſterie at that time: and God dyd impute vnto him his iuſtification, when he had not perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the preſcriptes of the lawe of Moyſes. Wherefore if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham the holy Patriarche did not obtayne his iuſtification by the merite of Circumciſion, but before Circumciſion, by the commendation and dignitie of fayth: I wonder howe it chaunceth that the Iewes truſt ſo muche in the Ceremonies of Moyſes lawe, vnto whom it was giuen but for a tyme. Alſo I greatly maruell why the Gentiles vſe ſo many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticiouſe Ceremonies, ſéeing they had no law at all giuen vnto them.

And al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes do know, that his iuſtification could not come to him throgh his circumciſion, ſéeing that at the preſent time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was called righteous, he was neither circumciſed nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be circumciſed.

Yet notwithſtanding it was neceſſarie for him to be circumciſed, not for that it ſhould iuſtifie him (which was alredy fulfilled) but that it ſhould be a certayne figure of the true circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come: that is, of an innocent and chaſt life to be in all ſuch as ſhould beléeue in Ieſus Chryſt.

Furthermore Abraham deſerued not to be pronounced righteous by kéeping of the lawe of Moyſes, which was not at that time declared: neither by the merit of circumciſion, neither yet had he deſerued any ſuche thing of God, that he ſhoulde promiſe to hym ſo noble a gyfte, as was to be the father of all Nations, and that the Lorde of all the worlde ſhoulde deſcende from him vnto his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as by inheritaunce: but it was onely through the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his fayth, by vertue whereof he was called iuſte: Euen ſo the Iewes ſhoulde ſuppoſe, that the goodneſſe and frute of his promiſe, commeth not to them for their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or for the names ſake of their law, but that it commeth to the poſteritie in ſuch ſort, as it began firſt in the head.<note place="margin">Gala. 3.</note> For if all whiche be borne vnder the Lawe of Moyſes, ſhould haue the promiſe of god pertaine only vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, then it ſhould ſeeme that the promiſe of God were vayne &amp; of none effect.

And if you demaunde of me how it chaunceth, that the law rather miniſtreth yre than righteouſneſſe, I will declare thus vnto you: you can make no man gyltie of any crime, onleſſe in laying the law agaynſt him you open his fault vnto him: the knowledge of which faulte the lawe miniſtreth and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Alſo the lawe of Moyſes preſcribeth many things, of circumciſion, of the Saboth dayes, of the feaſt of the new Moone, of the difference of meates, of mortuaries, of the ſtrangled, of bloud, of waſhing: all which be of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that though they be obſerued, yet they do not make a man righteouſe, but he that tranſgreſſeth them is gyltie and ſubiect to puniſhment by meanes of the law. But the law of Moyſes, ſeeing it chargeth no body but onely the Iewes: and agayne, ſéeing the inheritaunce of all nations is geuen of God vnto Abraham to be their father, it is impoſſible that the promiſe of God ſhoulde appertayne vnto all Nations, through the benefite of the Law, which is onely giuen to the Nation of the Iewes. It concludeth therefore, that the inheritaunce commeth by fayth, that our iuſtification may be ſéene to procéede of the onely grace and fauour of God, and not of any couenant or obſeruation of the law. And thus it is knowen how the goodneſſe of Gods promiſe deſcendeth to Abrahams poſteritie. And I doo not meane all them onely to be of Abrahams poſteritie, which be eyther of his kinred, or elſe ioyned with him in the law: but much rather all ſuch as expreſſeth Abrahams fayth. For it is muche more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the alliaunce and ſimilitude of fayth ſhoulde be of more efficacie, by which he deſerueth to receiue the promiſe of God, than the alliaunce and coniunction of the law, which engendreth offences, and maketh men gyltie of them.

By meanes wherof, waying the thing as it is, we haue much more occaſion to ſerue God than the deuill.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26975:35"/> to put vs alwais in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, of our hartie dutie &amp; good wil towards him. But I ſtand in dout, leaſt ſome man héere will obiecte againſt me and ſay: Séeing then, that in ſeruing the lawe, we were euer founde in ſinne of the ſame, and alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to deathe, it ſhall ſeeme to conclude, that the lawe was ſinne, and broughte vs to deathe: for as it is the propertie of rightuouſneſſe to bring men to life: euen ſo is it the propertie of ſinne to bring men to deathe. Wherefore, conſidering the law brought vs to death, it may be called ſinne, or (at the leaſt wiſe) ioyned patente to ſinne. But God forbid that any man ſhuld thinke ſo: for verily, the law is not the author of ſinne,<note place="margin">The lawe is not ſinnefull but it is the heraulde and meſſenger of him.</note> but the Herauld &amp; meſſenger of ſinne: which was vnknowne to vs, before the lawe was proclaimed: at which time, euery man folowing his owne ſenſualitie and luſt, thought that he might lawfully doe, what ſo euer his hart corruptly deſired: and thought it alſo lawfull to deſire that, which ſéemed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in his owne conceit. For which cauſe, pardoning and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering my ſelfe in this behalfe, I thoughte it none offence at all, to couet that, which did belong to another man:<note place="margin">Exod. 20. Deut. 5.</note> if the law had not ſaide vnto me: Thou ſhalt not luſt. And no man can denie but that the lawe was declared, for the coercion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of ſinne, though the thing it ſelfe hapned all contrarie vnto vs, throughe oure owne vice and imperfection. For, at what time the lawe did open vnto vs our ſinnes,<note place="margin">The law ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſinne but it geeueth no power to reſiſt ſinne.</note> and gaue vs not thereto might and ſtrength to reſiſt them: it came to paſſe that our luſte to ſinne, was made the more quicke and readie to it: bicauſe the nature of man is ſuch, that it moſt luſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thing, which is moſte forbidden it. How be it, before the knowledge of the law came many of our ſinnes we knew not: and ſome of them we knewe after ſuche a ſorte, that we perſuaded our ſelues, they were not forbidden vs. Throughe which reaſon, all we had the leſſe regarde to conſider what was luſt to ſinne: in as muche, as all we by nature, ſet ſmall ſtore by ſuche things, as we thinke we may haue at our will and commaundement. Wherefore, after the lawe had once ſet forthe the multitude of ſinnes to oure faces, and did forbid them to vs: then we were the more gréedie, to ſpot and defile
<pb facs="tcp:26975:36"/> our ſelues with the committing of them. By which occaſion, ſinne toke to himſelf ſtrength and encoragement in vs: which before the comming of the lawe, lay and ſlept, &amp; was as dead. At which time, I my ſelfe, when I knewe not the lawe, I led my life like an outlawe:<note place="margin">Through the lawe ſinne and the true record of conſcience, man feeleth in him ſelfe no life but death.</note> and thoughte within my ſelfe, that I might ſinne, withoute the committing of any offence to God. But when I perceiued the law, that did forbid me to ſinne: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſinne began to waxe ſtout and to abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in me, and to take the bridle in his téethe. Which, faring thus foule with me, wheras before I thought I liued, I became in mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtarke dead: bicauſe (by the law) I perceiued my dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound, and yet could not abſtaine from ſinning. Whereby it came to paſſe, that the thing which was prouided me of God for my helth, was made to me an occaſion of my death. Which thing, was not through any iniurie of the law, but it was only through mine owne vice, weakeneſſe &amp; imperfection. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in me a certain promptneſſe and readineſſe to ſinne, and my luſt alſo taking ſome occaſion by the lawe it ſelfe, bicauſe (as I ſaid before) men do moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly luſt after that which is forbidden them, I was then euen full of all gréedineſſe to ſinne. And thus the diuel vſing that wickedly, which of it ſelfe was good, enticed me vnto ſinne, by occaſion of the law: and by occaſion of ſinne, vnto death: to the end I ſhould acknowledge my ſelfe guiltie therof, and to be thrall vnto him for the ſame. Therfore thus you ſée then, that there is no cauſe why any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould contemne or depraue the lawe: which as it was giuen of God, who is alwayes perfectely good of him ſelfe: ſo it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned and ſet foorthe vnto al men, good and holeſome enſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">Eſay. 48. 1. Tim. 2.</note> For it cannot be choſen, but that the thing muſt néedes be good and godly, that hateth and forbiddeth ſinne and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe. And héer another will ſay vnto me: then, ſéeing the law which is good, bringeth with him that which is alſo good, why then ſhuld I ſay that it brought death vnto men, which is very naught, and hath alwais his beginning of ſinne and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Certeſſe a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſafely ſay thus vnto me. If in caſe the law ſhould engender ſinne, but the truthe is not ſo: for the law truly is not the author of death, but the cauſe of our death
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26975:36"/> is ſinne, which is in vs: who of it ſelfe is ſo wicked, that it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that thing which is very good, into naughte &amp; deſtruction. Yet notwithſtanding, that thing which is good and pure of his owne nature, openeth vnto vs howe filthie and vnſeemely a thing it is, which is naught and vitious: for that verily the law wrought, &amp; declared vnto vs the abhomination of our ſinnes, and was not the author and cauſe of them: for all men knowe that the lawe is ſpirituall, and alwayes ſtirreth men to honeſt things and ſpirituall actions: the which, bicauſe the law dothe not bring to effect that, which ſo much it deſireth to do: ſurely, to ſpeake of my ſelf, I am in the fault therof, and not the law. For in as much, as I am carnal and prone to ſinne, and by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the long continuance in it,<note place="margin">Eſay. 5 21.</note> am made as bond therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as a bond man vnto his maſter: and am ſo blinde &amp; drouned in vice and filthineſſe, that I cannot tel what I ought to do: for I doe not that thing, which knowledge and reaſon declareth vnto me to be honeſt (though I my ſelf do couet the ſame:) but I rather commit that thing, which is vnreſonable &amp; diſhoneſt: the which though I hate &amp; deteſt it: yet I do commit the ſame,<note place="margin">The power of ſinne in our earthly bodies.</note> bicauſe the vice and power of concupiſcence that is in me, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently compelleth and draweth me therunto: by which reaſon, the offenders them ſelues, will in no caſe that any fault ſhuld be imputed vnto the lawe, but to our owne fragilitie, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and great imperfection. For in as muche, as we in oure weakeneſſe, being ſo compelled to doe that thing (through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence) which knowledge and reaſon deteſteth, eſcheweth and damneth. I do therfore conſent to the law, that it is holy &amp; good, bicauſe it dothe of it ſelfe forbid the ſame thing, which the inward and ſpiritual part of my body grudgeth at, diſaloweth and vtterly da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth. Wherefore, the law which ſo ſtraitly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth all things that be euill, muſte néedes be counted holy, precious and good. Which, althoughe I commit ſuche euill, in obeying the motions of my fraile and corrupted fleſhe,) the outwarde parte and moſte groſe ſubſtaunce of man,) yet I wel perceiue them to be wicked and abhominable, &amp; that alſo in mine inwarde man, I hate and abhorre them. Héere will one then ſay vnto me: why doſt thou not then obey to thy ſpirit
<pb facs="tcp:26975:37"/> and inward man, which ſo conſenteth to the law that is good, and alſo ſtirreth thée to honeſtie and godly operations. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: For this ſame cauſe, we muſt imagine to be in eache one of vs two men:<note place="margin">Two men are poſſeſſed of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, and how they are called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſcripture.</note> the one of them groſe and carnall, and the other more pure and of leſſe corruption. The firſt may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the outward man, and the ſeconde, the inward man. The firſt is procliue and ready to ſinne: the ſecond, hauing in him, as it were certaine ſéedes of honeſty, is more appliant to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vertue: And according to his poſſibilitie and power, he gladly ſhunneth and ſtriueth againſte all corrupted motions and the filthie deſires of ſinne. Howe be it, that parte of vs is moſt properly called the man, which of it ſelfe is moſte pure and cleane, and beſt inclined. Therefore, as often as mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man conſenting to the goodneſſe of the lawe, is ſtirred, and ſo conſenteth to honeſtie, and yet doth the contrarie: it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth then, that it is not I that doth it: For what is he, which doth the thing that he hateth, and wanteth will to doe it? But héere is adioyned to mine outwarde man, a certaine prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and readineſſe to ſinne: by meanes wherof, it chaunceth ofte, that when I deſire to doe the thing which is honeſt and good, I am conſtrained to do that, which is hurtfull &amp; naught. In which groſe part of me,<note place="margin">Gene. 6.</note> I confeſſe to be no goodneſſe at al. For althoughe I deſire to doe that thing, which (according to reaſon and knowledge) is honeſt: yet I finde in me no power or ſtrength to worke that, which I moſte gladly eſtéeme and commend. But, in as much as this corrupted and carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, is in me of much more ſtrength and force, to driue me to offend, than is reaſon, which calleth me to the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vertue: I am forcibly drawne from the good vſe thereof, which I moſt ſpecially deſire, and do daily commit the ſinne and iniquitie, which I inwardly hate and moſte iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne. Conſidering therfore, that a man in doing euill, dothe it not voluntarily or with glad conſent, but by enforcement and againſte his will: then, when that thing is committed, which mine inward man moſt gladly repugneth and ſtriueth againſt: it is not truely and properly ſaid, that I am the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of the euill: but rather more aptly to be applied, to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26975:37"/> groſe deſire, promptneſſe and readineſſe of the outward man:<note place="margin">Sinne alwayes reſident in the outward man.</note> in whome alwayes ſinne is reſident, and beareth moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſway. Which promptneſſe to euill, the lawe cannot take away from me: but ſo ofte as I yéelde and obay to euill, then the lawe openeth and layeth plainely before me, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of my conſcience, the iuſt iudgement of God ouer me, and perpetuall condemnation to my ſoule. The good nature of reaſon and honeſtie (throughe the grace of God in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man) draweth me to the eſtimation of loue and vertue: wherunto, I am truely taught by the law: but I finde alſo an other law in the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of mine outward ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is clene contrary to the lawe of my inward ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and violently ſtirreth me to the gréedie embracement of euill. Therefore,<note place="margin">The conflicte betwixt reaſon and concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note> abiding thus alwayes in this caſe of conflict, that reaſon draweth me one way, and concupiſcence an other way: it commonly thus fortuneth, that the woorſe parte preuaileth, and reaſon ouer maſtred and laid on the ground. For the promptneſſe (I ſay) and readineſſe to ſinne, ſo muche aboundeth in me, as alſo the accuſtomed vſe thereof, through the vſual familiaritie &amp; great felowſhip which it euer hathe with my weake and fraile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that I am ſtill haled by conſtrainte like a bonde ſlaue or priſoner, vnto filthineſſe and ſinne, whether I will or will not. O miſerable wretche that I am, which am thus in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ſuche filthie ſlauerie and moſte bitter ſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: who ſhall deliuer me, and make me frée from this fleſh,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of the holy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle &amp; why?</note> or from this body of death, which is thus ſubiecte to ſo many miſeries, to ſo many prouocations, enticementes to naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, encombred with ſo many vices, and wel nigh confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with theſe daily conflictes, that alwayes haleth me, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me downe, and draweth me forcibly to deſtruction and death.

Chryſt did once dye in his fleſh (as is before ſayd) but now he liueth euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: whom we oughte to expreſſe in our ſelues in ſuche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that our earthly body, that is, our carnall and outwarde man, which always prouoketh vs to diſobedience and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, be dead in vs, and to forſake all vayne pleaſure that offendeth God: that the ſpirite, that is, our ſpirituall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man may liue in vs, which alwayes ſtirreth vs to all honeſtie,<note place="margin">The ſpirit of God what it worketh in the godly, that poſſeſſeth it.</note> to iuſt and godly things. Furthermore, if the ſpirite of God be within vs, which reſtored Chryſt from death vnto life, it is ſo frendly and frutefull vnto vs, that it will not be idle and vnoccupied in vs: for the ſpirite is louely, liuely, quicke, full of efficacie and vertue. Wherefore the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, according to our godly natures and inclination, will worke with mercy that thing in vs, which did moſt mightily worke in the Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. It reſtored him agayne from death vnto life, and will ſuffer him to dye no more: euen ſo it will call vs backe agayne from our ſinnes (which be the grounde of our death) and giue vs lighte to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde all wickedneſſe, and to lyue hencefoorth a deuoute and moſte godly life. Therefore all wée liuing to this ſpirite, are bounde to this ſpirite, and owe due obedience therevnto,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26975:40"/> and not to our fleſh, vnto which wée are already deade.<note place="margin">If we liue to Gods ſpirit, we are in all things bound to obey it.</note> For after wée became to bée made one with Ieſus Chryſte, wée became to bée no more debtors to the fleſhe.

And the ſame ſpirite alſo giueth ſuche an audacitie and boldeneſſe vnto vs all, that when ſoeuer we haue any neceſſitie (whether for ſoule or body) we ſhall not feare to call vpon God himſelfe, and ſay vnto him, father father. At which calling euery lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and naturall parent do glory and reioyce. Surely if we haue in conſideration the glory and highe maieſtie of God, his mightineſſe and heauenly power, we ſhould not once dare nor be ſo bolde to call him father, onleſſe we were moſte perfectly aſſured (through the goodneſſe of his holy ſpirite) that we be his very children,<note place="margin">2.

For to this ſame onely purpoſe he ſente vnto vs his moſte holy ſpirite, that it ſhould be a very ſure and earneſt gage vnto our ſpirite, that we are the vndoubted children of him, that gaue vs that heauenly gage. Wherefore ſéeing we be now made the children of God, and fully perſuaded that he is our father, we are no more to be counted ſeruaunts, but rather his very heires. For all men that beléeue in Ieſus Chryſt are the true heires of God, and felow heires with Chryſt him ſelfe, into whoſe body béeing engraffed through our Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we haue one father with him, and through his onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings we take participation with him of the heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce.<note place="margin">By what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we come to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance o God.</note> The poſſeſſion of which inheritaunce ſhall come vnto vs none other wayes than it came vnto Chryſt him ſelfe. For he through the afflictions and ſufferings of myſerable calamities in this lyfe, came duely to the poſſeſſion of thys highe inheritaunce. Through his obedience he came to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: through the ignominie and ſlaunder of the croſſe, he came to glorie, and through the pacient ſuffering of his death he came to the ſtate of immortalitie. Therefore all we muſte ſuffer with him, that we may haue the fruition of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce with him, we muſte obey that we may reigne with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26975:41"/> him, we muſte paciently beare the ſlaunders of this worlde, that with him we may haue prayſe and glory: and we muſte alſo dye with him to our ſinnes, that we may for euermore liue with him. After this maner doo we come to our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce with Chryſt, which bicauſe it is euerlaſting and of moſte high felicitie, I thinke, that if one onely man him ſelfe could poſſibly ſuffer all the calamities and miſeries of thys wretched worlde,<note place="margin">Math. 5. 2 Cor. 4. 1.

Yea, and though we haue receiued the gage of this felicitie and glory, to the ende we ſhoulde not miſtruſte any thing at all: yet for all that our glory can not be conſummate and made perfect in vs (although our bodies be ſubiecte to ſuche ſorte of miſeries and wretched calamities as be in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lyfe) without we haue our fayth ſtayed in the onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, death, and paſſion of our ſauiour Ieſus Chryſt. How be it in the meane time, through the helpe and comfort of the ſpirite, they are a certayne inwarde taſte of the ſame glory in vs. Which glory, at the reſurrection of the fleſh, and after the putting away from vs all our mortalitie, ſhall be fully declared and giuen vnto vs. At which tyme wée ſhall all liue immortall with Chryſt, that is, always immortall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, for our onely faythes ſake in his bloud. And that is the tyme, the which all the godly vniuerſally looke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for, as deſirous to beholde the comming of the ſame.<note place="margin">2.

And ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſubiection are the creatures of this worlde to myſeries, that the very circuite and compaſſe of the worlde it ſelfe ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to continue altogither in miſerie, as in example: the ayre, the earth, the water, with all other celeſtiall bodies: yea, the very angels them ſelues, are created to none other

For which cauſe the very buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the worlde it ſelfe, ſhall not be frée from trouble and diſquietneſſe, vntill ſuche time as perfecte fréedome ſhall be giuen to the children of God. Howbeit the worlde it ſelfe, though it be inſenſible, neither feeleth diſquietneſſe: yet there is in it a certayne naturall taſte and deſire to come to perfection. And in the meane tyme it obeyeth willingly to him: for whoſe pleaſure it was to make it in ſuche wyſe, ſubiecte to diſquietouſneſſe. Whiche ſo muche the more paciently abideth his ſorowe, bicauſe his naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dothe recorde to him him ſelfe, that hys ſorowe ſhall not bée perpetuall: but vntill ſuche tyme as the children of God ſhall fully and plenarily be deliuered from all their gréefe and carefulneſſe. At whiche tyme ſhall the whole Cope therof ceaſe from his great vnreſt and diſquietouſneſſe. Alſo, foraſmuche as we ſée that all the elements and planets of this worlde, do vary at ſo many and ſundry tymes: and doo ſée likewiſe, the Sunne and the Moone to haue ſo many Eclipſes and Chaunges: as alſo perceyuing by dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, what laboures are taken in vayne, for the repaire of things in this life, which do not continue, but fall agayne to their corruption. And beholding alſo the Starres, to alter and ſtriue one with another: and in concluſion, nothing to be in perpetuall reſte: It can not be choſen, but euen the very Angelles alſo of heauen looking downe by the power of God from an high vpon our infinite miſeries and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe are greatly diſmayed of them, moued at them, and ſorowe for them, as muche as their creation can ſuffer them to do.<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> Wherfore al the whole number of creatures and things made by the hands of God, do euen grone &amp; ſigh with vs in our miſfortunes. All which, after the maner of women laboring with child, wiſh and long for the ende of their great trauell and ſorowes. And herein is no maruell though it chaunce to others, conſidering the ſame happeneth to vs alſo, that firſte before all men haue receiued the ſpirite of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26975:42"/> Chryſt, which he gaue moſte abundantly vnto vs. Yet that notwithſtanding, we are entangled with thouſands of cares and myſeries: partely for the ſuſtentation of our lyues, and partely by the occaſion of wycked perſons, alwayes troubling and conſpiring agaynſt vs. Yea our cares are ſo many and variable, ſo gréeuous, terrible, and vnſufferable, that we oftentimes doo ſorow and lamente our owne wofull cauſes, moſte hartily wiſhing for that happie day, when all the true members of Ieſus Chryſt ſhal be ſet at libertie from all accidents, and ſhall be then made of very lumpiſh, groſſe and carnall men, moſte liuely, ſpiritual and immortal men. How be it wée paciently ſuffer all affliction in the meane tyme, for the hopes ſake of that felicitie, which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vs of our Lorde Chryſt. For the certayntie of which felicitie, although he haue giuen vs a ſure gage thereof, (euen the full certifying of his ſpirite:) yet he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it vnto vs wholly and fully at this tyme: but would that it ſhould with pacience be hoped vpon, taryed for, and looked for in tyme to come vnto vs. For our perfect health, expected reſte, and true felicitie, are in thoſe things that bée yet for to come: the vſe whereof,<note place="margin">Hebr 1.</note> wée verily truſte and hope vppon. For hope is not in thyngs that bée preſente and at hande amongſt vs, but onely in all ſuche things as doo not yet appeare vnto vs. For how can a man ſay, that wée haue hope in that thing, which is before our eyes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne there ſhoulde bée no place nor commendation lefte for fayth and hope, if thoſe thyngs ſhoulde bee nowe in our ſighte and féelyng, whych Chryſt hath promyſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Wherefore, conſidering wée conceyue in Faythe ſuche thyngs as bée not apparaunte to our bodyly eyes, wée doo paciently continue in our gréefes and ſorrowes, moſte ſtedfaſtly hoping for the promyſe made of Chriſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe it is paynfull in the meane while, to be in trouble and ſorow: howbeit, the ſame doth no harme, but rather wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the thing that is good: For the ſpirite taketh al things in good worth, and ſtriueth agaynſt the weakneſſe of the fleſh as muche as may be: and the ſpirite of God alwayes helpeth
<pb facs="tcp:26975:43"/> the debilitie of our mortall bodies, and dothe happily féede it with the good foode of hope, to ſuffer ſtrongly all offered inconueniences: declaring further vnto vs what we ſhould deſire to haue, holde and retayne, and what we ſhoulde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhunne and put away from vs. For all we (as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our fleſh) can not tell what to craue, nor how to deſire any thing that belongeth vnto vs: by meanes whereof it chaunceth that we oftentimes do deſire of God vayne and wicked things, in ſtéede of néedefull, honeſt, and holſome things. Which ſelfe ſame thing happened vnto me, at what time (not taking well in worth mine afflictions) I deſired God thrée times, that Sathan ſhould be baniſhed from me, who at that time very ſharply puniſhed me. Howbeit I was denied my requeſt, and in ſtéede of pleaſant things, or things contenting the fleſh, were giuen vnto me healthfull things. Yet verily, God heareth the petitions of his people, ſo that they make them not after the will of the fleſh, but after the will and healthfull motion of the ſpirite: which though we our ſelues ſay nothing at all,<note place="margin">Eſay. 26.</note> yet it ceaſſeth not to call vpon God for vs: not as men vſe to make their ſutes and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but with vnſpeakable feruencie, moſte déepe ſighings and inwarde gronings. A man muſte demaunde of others in way of communication, and ſo to attayne ſuche requeſts as he deſireth to be accompliſhed for him: which men know not what is demaunded, excepte he aduertiſe them of it: neither can they iudge what is moſte expedients for his neceſſitie. But God that knoweth the moſte ſecrete partes of mens hartes,<note place="margin">Iere. 17.</note> foreſéeth in ſuche maner our neceſſitie, that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth what the ſpirite requireth, and what we haue néede of, though we our ſelues (as God forbid) ſhoulde holde our peace,<note place="margin">In what maner the ſpirit pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for vs vnto God.</note> and make no ſute. For the ſpirite, as oftentimes as it demaundeth for holy things, and ſigheth for our miſeries, it prayeth vnto God, not after the affections of fleſh and bloud, but according to the onely will and pleaſure of almyghtie God. For it requireth nothing but healthfull things, and things appertayning to the glory of God. Which things whoſoeuer hartily deſireth (though he lacke in his requeſts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26975:43"/> order and forme in the making of them:) yet vndoubtedly he faileth not in the ende to attaine his purpoſe.<note place="margin">The feite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life are not to be feared not to withdrawe our harts from prayer.</note> God therefore graunteth vs, not that which is alwayes required of him: but rather that which moſte aptly toucheth oure commodities. Neither ought we to feare, or to ceaſe our praiers vnto God, though we ſée our ſelues toſſed in the miſeries of this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched world, in ſuche wiſe as though we were forſaken or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgotten of God: In as muche, as we all are certainely perſuaded, that all kinde of trouble (what ſo euer it be that happeneth vnto good men:) the ſame chaunceth vnto them, for their great health and welfare: for ſuche is the fauoure of God towardes thoſe, which he (of his moſte godly will and pleaſure) hathe choſen and called vnto felicitie. The purpoſe is youres, but the diſpoſition lieth in the handes of God him ſelfe: which hath not without moſt high conſideration, choſen to him ſelfe his moſte dearely beloued people. All thoſe that appertaineth properly vnto him, he right well knewe them, long before he called them. And he did not only before knowe them, whome he ſo called, but moſte ſecretely with him ſelfe he did predeſtinate them, to be incorporate into the bodie of his dear ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and to be tranſformed into the reſemblaunce and ſimilitude of him. Which, as he hath ouercome the power of the fleſh, death, hel, and the diuel, and is triumphantly aſcended into immortalitie: ſo likewiſe ſhould his members hope to doe, bicauſe they ſée the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie don in their head. Thus God, by this meanes (through his onely ſonne) hathe prouided him ſelfe of many ſonnes: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whome, Chriſt is the chéefe capitaine, and is the firſt begotten and principall heire of his eternall kingdom, which notwithſtanding, maketh vs partakers of his inheritaunce with him. Furthermore, all thoſe whome God knew before, and did chuſe them to himſelfe before all times, of whome he declared his godly pleaſure by his holy Prophetes: the ſame he hathe nowe at length called by his eternal goſpel: through which calling, they are moſt highly bleſſed and profited. For of wretched and ſinnefull liuers, he (throughe the abundance of his mercie) hath made them godly: and of wicked, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:26975:44"/> and ſtubborne ſeruants, his owne moſt deare and louing children. Vnto whom there now lacketh nothing, but onely their glory, and the moſt pleaſant peace &amp; quietneſſe of their conſciences in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of god, yet the ſame (at this time) want not all kinds of this glory: inaſmuche as it is a moſte plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt ſatiſfaction and comforte to their minds, that they (in this meane while) may liue frée from the threatnings of the law, from the daunger of the ſting of ſinne and death, and that ſo they may conforme them ſelues to innocencie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affections of the ſoule, that they may become one with Chryſt, and to haue always his ſpirite that ſhall ſatiſfie them with this moſt certayne perſuaſion, to be the heires of God, and felow heires with his ſon Chriſt, which alſo ſo confirme them, that they do not diſtruſte any thing of the fulfilling of this their euerlaſting glory and ioy, in his appoynted time. Wherfore, conſidering the matter goeth on this wiſe with vs: what neede haue we then to diſquiet our ſelues about the troubles &amp; miſeries that dayly happeneth vnto? Either why ſhould we not take them with all pacience:<note place="margin">We beare our troubles the more pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life, becauſe we ſee before hande the fauour of God for our deliueraunce.</note> ſéeing that ſuche is the grace and fauour of God, that he moſt mercifully min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our ſpeedy deliueraunce from thence? Surely God hath in ſo many things declared already his moſte high loue and goodneſſe towards vs, that we may be well aſſured he wil ſtil ſtand vnto vs, and be on our ſide a moſt ſtable piller agaynſt al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſaults of our deadly aduerſarie. Which always béeing moſt true: what cauſe haue we to care, or what can his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice preuayle agaynſt vs, ſeeing the moſte mightie God hym ſelfe taketh our parte?<note place="margin">Nume. 14. Eſay 50. Gene. 22.

He did embaſe his owne and onely ſonne, and made him vile, to the ende that thereby he would extoll and aduaunce vs: he made him a ſacrifice to deliuer vs from our offences: he deliuered him to his death, that by the meanes of it wee might haue life. Wherfore, ſéeing he thus
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26975:44"/> gaue his own deare ſonne for vs (in whom dwelleth the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of al things) ſhall it not then folowe, that he will alſo helpe vs with all things, as he doth his ſonne: In as muche as he hath made vs felow heires with him of the kingdome of his heauenly ioy? what will God ſticke to giue vnto vs (what ſoeuer it bée) whiche hath already fréely giuen that thing for vs, which is much more preciouſe than all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heauen and in earth? And all we may be well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that God will not chaunge his minde with vs, but (in the conſtancie of his mercy) will at all times be our buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, our ſhielde, and mightie defence,<note place="margin">Our hope in the conſtancie of Gods mercy for our ſheelde and buckler.</note> agaynſt the outrage and force of all our aduerſaries. What is he therefore, that will or once dare take vppon him to bring any accuſation, or lay any condemnation agaynſt the electe of God: whom he hath now (by hys moſte high wiſedome) choſen and taken for his owne deare ſonnes? Thinke you that God will heare the aduerſarie of our ſoule, agaynſt thoſe whom his onely ſonne hath ſo preciouſly redeemed, and for his ſake hath ſo frely pardoned and forgiuen their offences againſt him? God that is the iudge of all creatures hath deliuered vs from the gyltineſſe of our former life, &amp; now accounteth vs righteous in his ſight.

Howbeit Abraham begatte other children after that time, of other wiues, yet the promiſe was onely made in the name of Iſaac. And as the thing went with Iſaac and the other children of Abraham: euen ſo it alſo chaunced in Iacob and Eſau.

And why did God thus I pray you? Or what would he declare vnto vs héereby? Certeſſe, none other thing at all, but that no creature, through his confidence in the law or circumciſion, ſhould chalenge to him ſelfe the promiſe of felicitie: but only all ſuche as haue faythe, to come to the

For the election of God maketh the children of Abraham,<note place="margin">The election of God, maketh the children of Abraham, but not the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of birth.</note> and not the propinquitie of birth. Wherefore, if in caſe God ſhall reiecte and caſte away the Iewes at this time, as he in times paſte did Eſau: it ſhall profite them nothing at all, to haue diſcended of his lynage. Agayne, if God do call the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles vnto his promiſe by vertue of their fayth, it ſhall not hurt them one whit to be of no fleſhly kinred with Abraham: in as muche as God through grace doth adopte and make them his children. And here no man ſhall take occaſion to wreſte the Scriptures, and ſay peruerſely, that men are not in fault them ſelues of their owne damnation, but rather God him ſelfe: bicauſe he receiueth at his will and pleaſure thoſe that do no good, and put away from him ſuche as may ſéeme to doo no hurte. God defende therefore, that in reading this ſaying of Moyſes in the Booke of Exodus:<note place="margin">Exod. 33.</note> I will ſhew mercy vppon whom I ſhew mercy: and will haue compaſſion, vpon whom I haue compaſſion: ſhould thinke therby that God doth any wrong vnto vs, in taking away from vs all our owne power and ſtrength, to obtayne health and ſaluation: bicauſe that both our willes and labours are but vayne and to no purpoſe, except the willing God draweth vs: which draweth onely all ſuche as beſt lyketh him, though they had don no good at al.</p>

                  <hi>VVe muſte vvell conſider this place of Scripture in Exodus, that God of his ovvne abundant mercy, hath made euery man to his ovvne ſimilitude, and giuen him in his creation, vvitte, reaſon and diſcretion, vvith many other beginnings of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godlyneſſe. All vvhich, if man for his parte vvill apply to the vvill of God, and call vpon him for the encreaſe of hys ſtrength, and to make in him theſe vertues fruitefull, and to be alvvayes fortified by the ſpirite of Chryſt to godly perfection and true pietie: then God for his loue and mercies ſake vvill performe the ſame to his ſaluation: vvhich othervviſe his ovvne ſtrength can not bring to paſſe by any poſsibilitie.

And this he doth not to that ende, that a man ſhould complayne or quarell with him, but with al humbleneſſe to ſubmit him ſelfe, &amp; moſt hartily to thanke him for it.

For albeit that no man is of power, nor can once reſiſte the holy will of God: yet for all that his will is neuer ſo mercileſly bente agaynſt vs, that he is found the cauſe of our perdition: neither did he harden the heart of the proud Egyptian Pharao, to that ende he would in déede make him ſtubborne and ſtifnecked, and therby wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully damne him: but well foreſéeing and knowing by hys omnipotencie and godly wiſedome, that his heart was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hardened, and that through his owne wilfull malice and great pride: which, though at that tyme it deſerued at the hande of God by his iuſtice, ſhorte and ſodayne deſtruction: yet he for a ſpace dyd ſuffer it to continue in him, and in the meane tyme through gentleneſſe, by lyttle and lyttle dyd puniſhe and correcte it: bothe that Pharao ſhoulde the better perceyue and knowe in him ſelfe hys owne wylfull wickedneſſe, throughe hys malyce, pryde, and ſtoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and alſo for the more playne manyfeſtation vnto all generations, of hys owne omnipotencie, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe and great clemencie, throughout the whole world.

<pb facs="tcp:26975:50"/> worthily count it, for an high token of his great loue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie towards vs: in that he maketh the miſſehap or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſome men, to tourne to the good and fortunate ende of others. Alſo reaſon thus with thy ſelf: if thou be deformed and filthy in the fight of God through thine inclination to ſinne, O miſerable creature that I am, I muſt duely acknowledge and confeſſe, that god of his onely great mercy and goodneſſe, hath miraculouſly wrought his good worke vpon me, &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me both in ſoule &amp; body, with innumerable of his good graces, bleſſings &amp; benefits: &amp; not made me a deformed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or veſſell of diſhonor vnto filthineſſe &amp; vnclenneſſe: but I my ſelfe through the diuell and mine owne conſente, haue made my ſelf filthy and vncleane, and defiled moſt lothſomly the beautifull worke of God, with the dirte &amp; ſtinch of ſinne and mine own vnclenneſſe. Wherfore I ſay, if God (through his owne infinite wiſedome) do vſe thy wickedneſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate to the healthfull ſtate of the godly, and to the hygh renoume of his owne name: what iuſt occaſion then of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, or to thinke euill of God haſte thou? In which caſe thou art worthily delte withall and iuſtly puniſhed (thyne own conſcience bearing thée witneſſe) for thy forgetfulneſſe, pride, careleſneſſe, wilfull contempt &amp; ſtubborneſſe. And the good &amp; godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through the example of thée in thy wretched ſtate, are made the more ware &amp; circumſpect to them ſelues, how they fall into ſinne, to haue gods feare before their eies, and to thank him with more alacritie &amp; franke corage, when they do wel learne &amp; perceiue by thy wilful blindneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, how much they be bound vnto the great goodneſſe &amp; mercy of God towards them. Pharao which was brought to nought through his own ſin &amp; malice, had none occaſion at al to reproue god, thogh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame his malice &amp; wilful ſtubbornes did greatly aduaunce &amp; ſet forth the glory of god amongſt his people y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues: euen ſo, what occaſion haue the Iewes at this time to repine againſt god,<note place="margin">Gods great mercy towards the ſtubborne Iewes.</note> which now in like maner (as he did in times paſt with Pharao) doth gently ſuffer &amp; beare with their ſtubborneſſe? Al which, though they be in dede veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels worthy the iuſt reproch of god, &amp; to be caſt by him againſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:26975:50"/> the walles and broken: yet this notwithſtanding, God (in mercie) did pauſe with him ſelfe towardes them, to the ende it might be well perceiued and knowne vnto all creatures, that moſte iuſtly they haue deſerued their owne deſtruction. And all which, though they haue bene allured to the goſpell, by a thouſande benefites of God, and many ſundry occaſions of gentleneſſe towardes them: yet they would not correct and amende them ſelues. By which meanes all other men may take vnto them good and ſpeciall occaſion, to dread and feare the omnipotencie of God, and moſte hartily yéelde them ſelues bounde vnto him for his vnſpeakable loue towards them, whom they ought not to prouoke to anger through the continuance of ſinne: but vtterly to be at defiaunce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and to deteſt it from their hearts, for his holyneſſe and great gentleneſſe ſake. All which things haue ben thus won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully wrought of God, to the end that he would the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and excellencie of his glory, ſhould be the more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly &amp; abundantly manyfeſted vnto al the godly: whom he (of filthy and moſt vile veſſels) hath happily clenſed them, and made them louely, fayre and preciouſe: and hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame to a moſt honeſt vſe: that is, euen to haue the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inexplicable ioyes of heauen, which he bringeth to paſſe in vs, not for the loue of our circumciſion, but onely for the merite of fayth: through whiche onely all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doo come to this prepared ioy: not onely the Iewes, but alſo all other nations, which giue their ful confidence &amp; truſt, to the onely ſhedding of Chryſts moſt innocent bloud, for their purgation or moſte perfecte clenſing, for it is not the birth or poſterity by Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that maketh the heires of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the onely election of god the father, in &amp; by his ſon Ieſus Chriſt. And the Iewes ſhould not maruel, that the Gentiles, which all were once prophane &amp; ſtrangers from Chryſt, are now adopted and become the children of God, conſidering themſelues, that once were before thys time through their owne malice, deſpiſed &amp; caſt out of Gods fauour: yet the ſame taking repentaunce, and amending their liues, came agayne vnto grace, and that by the méekeneſſe &amp; gentleneſſe of God.
<pb facs="tcp:26975:51"/> The which very thing, their owne prophet Ozée witneſſeth, ſaying in this manner:<note place="margin">Oſee. 2. 1. Pet. 2.</note> I wil call them my people, which are not my people: and my beloued, which are not my beloued: and to diſpoſe my mercie, where I had no mercie. And ſo it came to paſſe, that whereas before they were not the people of God, they were called againe the children of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why ſhould they condemne that in others, of which they them ſelues, haue had ſufficient experience? They ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue taken diligent héede, that through their owne fall, they ſtoode in greater daunger, not to come againe into the ſame caſe, that they were in before. And what cauſe haue they to hate the Gentiles ſo muche as they doe: whome they ought to imitate &amp; folow, in their conuerſation and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners: if they had not rather delite to deſpiſe, than gently to obay? And although that the moſt part of them (through their own ſtubburnneſſe) did periſh: yet, he wil neuertheleſſe performe the promiſſe to the remnaunt that doe beléeue: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, he made vnto all ſuche as would receiue it by faithe. And although the ſame be but a few in number:<note place="margin">Eſay. 10. Oſee. 1. Zacha. 13. Amos. 9.</note> yet they ſhal be continuall ſucceſſors to receiue the ſame promiſſe. The ſame thing doth Eſayas teſtifie, which ſayeth: Thoughe the children of Iſraell be in number equall to the ſandes of the ſea, and that numbers and multitudes of them, doe periſhe by their owne vice and naughtineſſe: yet for all that, there ſhall alwayes be ſome of them that ſhall be ſaued throughe their faithe. And alſo the number of them that fal from God, though it be greate: yet, the vice and malice of them cannot cauſe God to breake his promiſſe with the faithfull. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the performance of their promiſſes, it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of men: but God moſt aſſuredly performeth in déede, all ſuche things as he doth promiſſe, and that without any delay or daliance: neither yet deceitfully, but moſt truely and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.</note> fulfilleth all his beheaſtes. The which thing, the Prophet Eſay affirmeth and ſayeth: God will make a bréefe and ſhort reckening vpon the earth. And the ſame alſo ſayeth: Excepte the Lord of hoſtes had left vnto vs ſome ſéede, we ſhuld haue bene made like vnto Sodome: and ſhould haue bene none
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26975:51"/> otherwiſe eſtéemed than Gomor. By all which things are vnderſtanded, that though numbers of the Iewes did forſake Chryſt: yet notwithſtanding, he will not ſuffer all the true and lawfull ſéede of Abraham to fall and come to naught. Which thing,<note place="margin">The mercy of God towardes the Gentiles.</note> conſidering it went after this ſorte with the Iewes, it pleaſed almightie god that the Gentiles, which ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med once to be farre from his righteouſneſſe, and without all the ceremonies of the law, ſhould now attayne to the ſame righteouſneſſe (which is not the righteouſneſſe of the Iewes, that had onely but the ſhadow of true righteouſneſſe) but it was in déede the very righteouſneſſe of God him ſelfe: and that not through the ceremonies of the lawe, but by their onely fayth: through which they ſubmitte them ſelues to the goodneſſe and mercy of God. But contrarywiſe, the Iewes, folowing the law of righteouſneſſe carnally,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the Ievves fall.</note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing righteouſneſſe to them ſelues by the ſame lawe (through their ceremonies and obſeruaunces) could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto this true righteouſneſſe in God, bicauſe they dyd forſake Chryſt: in whom, and for whom, were all the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the holy Prophets ſpoken, and the law declared.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare brethren, verily I ſay this vnto you, not without great ſorow and heauineſſe of harte, bicauſe I inwardly wiſhe with the ſame, the happie ſtate and proſperitie of the Iewes. And if it were in mine abilitie and power, I would moſt gladly reléeue them, and eaſe them of their fal and moſt wretched miſchaunce. But of this thing they be all aſſured and out of doubt, that I pray to God dayly and hartily for them, that they may yet once agayne turne to repentaunce, and not thus alwayes to continue in their damnable blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Surely I can not excuſe them of their vnbeléefe: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, ſomewhat may yet be ſayde in that behalfe for their comforts: for they be not ſo farre from Chryſt, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were: for aſmuche as he is ſomewhat néerer the truthe, that knoweth ſome parte thereof, than he that knoweth yet nothing at all. For which cauſe I would the rather wiſh, that the ſame thing may now be brought to good effecte in them, which they heretofore went about: and that they may now obtayne the very truth it ſelfe, wherof long ſince they haue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26975:52"/> had but the tipe and ſhadowe. And although they did fall into a moſte horrible and lamentable vice, in that they ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly crucified the Lord, which was the fountaine of al glory: yet notwithſtanding the ſame, I muſte néedes confeſſe,<note place="margin">Eſay. 28. Roma. 9.</note> that they did it for ſome loue which they bare towardes God, thoughe it were done, neither with wiſdome nor iudgement. For their entent was, to call himſelf the ſonne of God: which in their opinions, was a deteſtable blaſphemie to the Father of heauen: but in this pointe, their carnall reaſon was decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Wherefore, they did not altogither miſſe in the affection of godlyneſſe, thoughe the ſame did miſſe in the ordering, and in the right applying therof: and better it is to haue ſome one kinde of religion, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue none at all. Alſo, they did deſerue (thoughe they had but little godlineſſe in them) to haue had more giuen vnto them, if they had not bene ſo ſtiffe necked in their firſte rules of godlineſſe, hauing in contempte the true godlineſſe it ſelfe, when it was once offered vnto them: and alſo if they had not maintained, and ſo ſtoutly fortified theyr ſhadowes and only ſimilitudes of truthe: and in ſteade therof, to deride and mocke the veritie and perfect truth it ſelfe. And euery of them, though they ſhould not then, haue caſte of from them their lawe of Moſes: yet they did ſtrius for the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, without all knowledge or godly iudgement. In the doing of which, they contended againſt him, for whom the whole lawe was firſte made and proclaimed. For theyr holy dayes, their Circumciſion, their differences of meates, the auoyding from deade carcaſes, their Faſtings, their Feſtiuall dayes, were all appoynted for this intent, that they ſhoulde paſſe foorthe for their time in theſe ſortes of beginning: and to pretende by the outwarde or worldly rightuouſneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a comming (at the time appoynted) to the true rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of almightie God.</p>
               <p>Howe be it, it was not conuenient for them, that for the loues ſake and affection they then had to their Ceremoniall rightuouſneſſe, to deſpiſe &amp; caſt him away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, for whoſe only cauſe al their lawe &amp; Ceremonies were ordained: but the more pitie it is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, though they had (in moſt large
<pb facs="tcp:26975:53"/> and godly maner) declared truely vnto them all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God: yet they would not forſake the worldly righteouſneſſe of their Ceremonies, but moſte peruerſly and without all good order ſought to vpholde the continuaunce of them. For they ſo ſtiffely defended their olde righteouſneſſe (which in déede was made of none effecte, and is now rather become to all men which truſt therein, their deadly wound and ſting) that they would not once know the true ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, but ſtil waſting their liues in Ceremonies, they reſiſted the Goſpell of Chryſt, wherevnto they ſhould haue ſubmitted them ſelues with all humbleneſſe and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſgiuing, if in very déede they had ben mindefull to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. For we muſt imagine thus with our ſelues, as though there were before vs two kinde of righteouſneſſes:<note place="margin">Two kinds of righteouſneſſe</note> the one hath Moyſes for their author, the other hath Chryſt. The firſte ſtandeth in the fulfilling of Ceremonies, the ſeconde conſiſteth in the fayth of Ieſus Chryſt, and in the obedience to his Goſpell. The firſt of theſe two was but the preamble and firſt beginning of the ſeconde: euen as a ſtocke or rough péece of woode is the beginning of the Image that is made thereof: or elſe as the crudding togither of the bloud is the beginning of the iſſue that commeth therof. Therfore it ſhall be but extreme fooliſhneſſe to ſticke to the beginning, and to be ſetled with delight therein,<note place="margin">Chriſt the end of the lavve.</note> when we haue once receiued the perfecte iſſue and true thing it ſelfe. And euen thus is Chryſt the very perfect iſſue or ende of Moyſes law: which was in déede but a very weake and vnperfecte beginning of our righteouſneſſe. And this ſame iſſue is fedde and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to be our helpe and comforte in time to come, with the moſte delicate, deyntie, and ſweete milke of fayth: and not with the da lying toyes of Circumciſion, or other the like tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Ceremonies. The comming vnto which righteouſneſſe is not onely graunted vnto the Iewes, but alſo to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and finally to all them that beleeue in Chryſt Ieſus. Both which righteouſneſſes Moyſes did ſet foorth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of them in his lawe. Of the which two, the worldly righteouſneſſes, he mentioned in the Booke of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26975:53"/> Leuiticus: and it ſtoode in Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Gala. 3. Leuit. 18.</note> that were but for a time appoynted, and ſayd: kéepe my lawes and iudgements: which, who ſoeuer ſhall do them, ſhall liue in the ſame. And he likewiſe declared the ſeconde righteouſneſſe, which is euerlaſting, and is obtayned by the onely merite of our liuely fayth in Ieſus Chryſt,<note place="margin">Deutero. 30.</note> as in the Booke of Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mij, where he ſayth: Thou ſhalte not ſay in thine heart, who aſcendeth into heauen? for that is to plucke Chryſt out of heauen. Agayne, let no man ſay: who deſcendeth into the depth of the earth? for that is to call Chryſt agayne from death. And herein is a likelyhoode, that the ſame man belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth neither of them bothe, which demaundeth the practiſe or experience of them. But who ſoeuer beléeueth truely and ſincerely knoweth this for a more ſuretie, than to ſeeke for any further aduertiſement thereof: that is, that Chryſt dyd once deſcende from heauen, and aſcended thither againe, and now ſitteth on the right hande of his father: both which are moſte true, though we doo not now ſée them with our bodily eyes. Alſo, that he deſcended into the hels, and from thence returned agayne, and ſtill liueth, though the ſame be vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to our outwarde ſenſes: yet it ſhall be ſufficient for vs to beléeue, that all this was once done &amp; fulfilled. Therfore nothing elſe now remayneth to vs, and to al thoſe that did ſée theſe things brought to paſſe with their owne eyes, but only to beléeue his holy Goſpell. And we néede not ſéeke very farre to here the truth of all this: for the Iewes themſelues dyd behold and ſée it fulfilled, and yet did not beléeue it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, there were many that heard of it, and did not ſée it, and yet they beléeued it. Neither is there concealed or hidden from vs among the whole ſcriptures, any one parte of this poynte, but they doo witneſſe the ſame: and biddeth vs to haue recourſe vnto the Goſpell, for the very certayntie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſayth thus to vs: The worde is néere vnto thée: euen in thy mouth and in thy hearte. And what woorde is this, that the Scripture here ſpeaketh of? verily, euen the onely worde of the Goſpell, which bringeth with it perfect health, and is now preached of vs, whom Chryſt hath appoynted
<pb facs="tcp:26975:54"/> for the ſame purpoſe.<note place="margin">Hovv the vvord of God is in our mouth &amp; in our hart.</note> But how is it in thy mouth, and in thine heart? It is verily in thy mouth, if thou doeſt confeſſe with thy mouth, and acknowledge vnto al men, that our lord Ieſus Chryſt is already come, and hath ſuffred for vs. And it is in thine heart, if thou do beléeue vnfaynedly with all thine heart, that God hath reſtored him agayne vnto euerlaſting life: that we hereafter may dye with him to our ſinnes, and euermore to liue with him for the deſerts ſake of his paſſion, death &amp; reſurrection. For in our hearts is our right beléefe: which beléefe is the true &amp; vncounterfeited key, to open the doore vnto righteouſneſſe. Notwithſtanding, bicauſe wée be bound to glorifie God, it ſhall not be ſufficient for vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this faith in our hearts: but alſo to acknowledge &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt amongſt men with our mouthes, if we wil come to our perfecte health and ſaluation. But in all theſe you cléerely ſée, that the ſumme of this matter dependeth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Law and Ceremonies, but onely vppon true fayth in Chryſt: the which Eſaias the prophete witneſſeth, where he ſpeaketh of Chryſt,<note place="margin">Eſay. 28.</note> who ſoeuer (ſayth he) ſhall beléeue in him, ſhall not be aſhamed. In which words we muſte dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marke, that wheras the Prophete ſayth: who ſoeuer ſhall beléeue: he playnely maketh no difference betwéene the Iewes and the Gentiles, but meaneth them all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. Alſo whereas he ſayth: ſhall beléeue: he meaneth not Circumciſion, or any other ſuche lyke thing: but vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the Ceremonies, he onely requireth our fayth: which is vnto all Nations an vniuerſall gyfte and vertue. Further, God is ſuche a one, that he is not Lorde to the Iewes onely, but generally to all nations, kinreds, and people: whoſe large benefite, is not ſo ſtraytely pinched in and ſhutte into an onely angle or corner of the worlde, or that it ſhould onely appertayne to them of Iewry: and ſo peraduenture of them to be ſo cleane ſupped vp, that nothing thereof ſhall remayne vnto others: but hys bountyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is without all meaſure, and ouerfloweth not to one onely Nation or twayne: but ſtretcheth foorth withoute exception to all kinreds and people: ſo that the ſame call
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26975:54"/> onely vppon him for his helpe and ſuccour,<note place="margin">Miche. 2. Act. 2.22.</note> with an earneſt and vndoubting fayth. And euen thus teſtifieth the Prophet Micheas: Euery man (ſayth he) that ſhal call vpon the name of the Lorde, ſhall be ſaued. Héere you well ſée, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet excepteth no man. Therefore whoſoeuer with a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, ſhall call vppon the name of God (whether he be Iew, Gentile or ſtranger) ſhal come vnto his ſaluation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, whoſoeuer ſhall not call vpon the name of hym, ſhall not be ſaued. How beit, no man calleth vppon him, or demaundeth his helpe and ſuccour, in whom he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue: And how ſhall men beléeue on him, of whom they haue not heard? Agayne, how can men héere of him excepte there bée ſome to preach of him? And how can men preach him, if there bée none ſent to doo it: namely of him to whom the Goſpell appertayneth. Of whiche preachers Eſaias ſpeaketh and ſayth: O how beautifull and precyo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e are the féete of them that preache peace,<note place="margin">Eſay. 52.</note> and of them that tell good things? Héere you perceiue by the Prophete, that all the Preachers of Chryſt are commaunded to Preache, not Circumciſion and holy dayes, but the peace that coupleth vs togither in perfecte charitie: and ſuche other good things as be alwayes good, and good of their owne nature. And there is nothing now lefte behinde vnpreached, that toucheth the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of mortall men to their ſaluation: in as muche as the Goſpell of Chryſt is preached vnto all Nations, though they doo not all beléeue it, and giue their onely truſt thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For euen ſo the Prophete Eſay ſayde that it ſhoulde ſo come to paſſe (ſpeaking in the name of the Apoſtles) Lorde (ſayd he) who did beléeue our ſermons and preachings?<note place="margin">Eſay. 53. Iohn. 12.</note> For among the Nations, there bée very few that beléeue the Goſpell of Chryſte, if they bée compared to them that doo not beléeue it. Let vs therefore gather togither in a ſumme thoſe things that we haue ſpoken of before: which is, if the calling vpon God, do bring health vnto men: and agayne, if they that doo not truſt in him, doo not call vppon him, then is fayth ſpecially of a Chriſtian man, required before all things, and not Circumciſion or the cuſtomes of the Lawe.
<pb facs="tcp:26975:55"/> Further, fayth is conceiued in the hart of man, not by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of outward things, but only by godly Sermons and preachings of the true Apoſtles of Chriſt: that is, fayth is not conceyued by the eyes, but by the eares: the office of which conueyeth the preachings and godly exhortations into the obedient and lowly harte of man. Now therefore, ſith the light of the Goſpell is declared throughout all the worlde, and the name of Chryſt preached to euery body: what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it then, that ſo fewe of the Iewes doo beléeue in him? Can they excuſe them ſelues &amp; ſay, that they haue not heard of Chryſt?<note place="margin">Pſalm. 18.</note> yea verily, the ſame thing is now already fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which the Prophete Dauid did Propheſie. Throughout the whole earth wente foorth the ſounde of them, and their wordes vnto the endes of the earth. Wherfore, in as much as Chryſt hath bene promiſed before times by the mouth of ſo many Prophets, and now preached alſo of the Apoſtles (his very true witneſſes) in all nations and regions of the worlde: can the Iewes then excuſe them ſelues, and ſay that they heard not of him? No verily, for they haue ſéene the light of the worlde, yet their malice hath blinded their eyes. They haue heard the Goſpell, but their enuie hath ſtopped their eares. For they had rather be enuiers of the Gentiles, which are called to ſaluation, than to folow their fayth. And of both theſe two things did Moyſes and Eſaias heretofore propheſie: that, is, that the Iewes would caſte the Goſpell away from them, and that the Gentiles woulde receiue it. And Moyſes in Deuteronomij prophecied of the ſame, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſpeaketh of the perſon of God (as offended with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beléefe of the Iewes) and ſayth:<note place="margin">Deutero. 3 2.</note> I will prouoke you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and by a fooliſh nation I will anger you: which hitherto, in compariſon of you, was not taken nor counted for any nation. And you, which doo ſéeme in your ſelues to bée wiſe, I will anger you through the ſame fooliſh and beaſtly nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſe your anger to be a great deale the more hotte in you. And Eſaias folowing Moyſes, doubted not to teſtifie that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of the Gentiles, was much more acceptable to God, than the pertinacie and ſtubborneſſe of the Iewes:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26975:55"/> for thus he ſpeaketh in the perſon of Chryſt:<note place="margin">Eſay. 52.65.</note> I am founde of them that ſought me not, and haue appeared vnto them that aſked not after me. Lo, what a worthy witneſſe Chryſt him ſelfe here recordeth of the Gentiles fayth. But agayne the children of Iſraell, whom it dyd ſpecially become to embrace Chryſt and his Goſpell, hearken here what Eſay ſayth:<note place="margin">Eſay. 65.</note> All the day long (ſayth he) haue I ſtretched foorth mine hande vnto a people that beleeueth not, but ſpeaketh agaynſt me. For which cauſe (Chryſt ſayth by the ſame) I haue ſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes vnto the Iewes, which they haue all ſlayne and put to death: and by the multitude of miracles done amongſt them, I haue ſtirred and prouoked them: but in ſtéede of the thanks, which they ſhould haue giuen me for them, they ſay that I had the diuell within me: and that with the helpe and power of Béelzebub (the prince of the Diuels) I wrought all the ſayde miracles. And euen thus they deſpiſed all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and obedience, and miſconſtrued to euill parte, the great vertue and power of almightie God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26975:56"/> of them to be his owne deare dearlings and creatures: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe, if God had caſte all hys owne people away from hym, then ſhoulde not I now haue preached Chryſt: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as muche as I am by birthe a very Iewe, deſcending from the ſtocke of Abraham, which appertayneth to the Trybe of Beniamin. Whiche alſo, thoughe I dyd moſte cruelly perſecute the godly and well dyſpoſed people towardes God: yet for all that I am now called to preache the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of his deare Sonne Chryſte. Alſo I doo not doubte but yée very well remember what is written in the thirde Booke of Kinges, where Helias the Prophete ſpeaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD, by accuſation and complaynte vnto hym of the Iewes vngodlyneſſe,<note place="margin">3 Reg 19.</note> and ſayth: Lorde, they haue ſlayne thy Prophetes: they haue ouerturned thyne Altares: and I am lefte alone behynde, and they lay alſo in wayte for me, to take my lyfe from me. Wherein alſo mée thinketh, that God mighte iuſtely (vppon this greate vnkindeneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie of the Iewes) haue caſte them vtterly from him, and neuer afterwards haue looked towardes them. But yet for all this,<note place="margin">3.

Which thing, as it dyd chaunce in the dayes of Helias, that God woulde not then altogither renounce his people, but of an infinite number of ſinners, reſerued ſome (a few of them to him ſelfe,) euen ſo doothe the ſame thyng chaunce vnto them at this tyme. For God hathe not ſuffered all the whole Nation to periſh and to caſte them ſelues away: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffreth he all men of any other Nation to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in their ſinnes and to dye in them. Of bothe whiche, though there be but a few that do beléeue, in compariſon of them that doo not beléeue: yet God for his benignities ſake, reſerued ſome of his owne people to him ſelfe: not bicauſe they were Iewes borne, or bicauſe they obſerued the Law of Moyſes:<note place="margin">Deutere. 9.</note> but onely bicauſe he choſe them out from all the reſte, to beſtow vpon them his good graces, bleſſings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites: in as muche as it came by the election and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26975:56"/> of God, and not of any their deſeruings, leaſt they ſhould extoll the largeneſſe of their owne will and power, or glory in the beautie of their owne workes: for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is beſtowed vppon men for their well dooing, is properly to be called a rewarde, and not a benefite. That is truely to be called a benefite: whiche of good will is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed vnto them that doo not deſerue it. But if a man ſhould heape vp all his good works and ſeruice togyther, and lay them agaynſt the benefite, and for their ſakes to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame: then the benefite loſeth the name of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, and becommeth playnely a iuſte rewarde. And why did it thus happen vnto the Iewes? verily bicauſe they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned not to that thing, which they expected by the law, and that for their vnbeléefes ſake.<note place="margin">What they be that atteine vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God.</note> But they onely attayne to their ſaluation, whiche looke not for it by Circumciſion or kéeping of the law: but onely of frée mercy, and for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake of God.

And all they, though they did ſée Chryſt with their bodily eyes:<note place="margin">Eſay. 9. Act. 7.</note> yet with the eyes of their hearts and minds they ſaw him not. And this ſame dyd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias propheſie ſhould come vppon them: which at this day as I truely ſée it come to paſſe, ſo with mine vnfayned hart, I doo lamente and ſorowe it. For the which, bicauſe they ſo wretchedly caſte from them the moſte gracious and good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Chryſt: God hath ſent vnto them the ſpirite of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe: a ſpirite that is harde, full of prickes, and very rough to be handled. For though they ſée with their bodily eyes: yet notwithſtanding, they are ſo inwardly blinded and amaſed, that they ſay, and ſo ſhew them ſelues, to ſée nothing at all. And though they alſo heare with their outward eares, yet they are therwith no more moued than though they herd

Which vice, is moſt reprocheful before the face of God: and the ſelfe ſame euil it was, that ſo greatly blinded the vnhappy Iewes.<note place="margin">Pride the fall of the Iewes.</note> How be it, it did not blinde them al, and that for euer: for many of them do confeſſe Chriſte: and the other ſhall continue in their blindneſſe, vntill ſuch time, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number of the Gentiles ſhall be fulfilled: vnto whom, the fall of the Iewes hath thus occaſioned them to be called to the goſpell.<note place="margin">The time of the Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion vnto Chriſt.</note> Wherfore, the Iewes when they ſhall ſée &amp; perceiue, that all the world doth floriſh in the true profeſſion of Chriſt: then ſhal they confeſſe their owne blindneſſe: that is, that they looke, and haue looked for their Meſſias in vaine, their Citie, their temple, and their ſacrifices: and that the very true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias is come already, which is Ieſus Chriſte oure Lorde. And thus in time,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.</note> ſhall all thoſe people of Iſrael be reſtored again to their true health &amp; ſaluation, though the ſame (at this time) be yet partly gone away from them. And then ſhall the ſame people be worthy of their owne name, when they ſhall begin to behold Chriſt with the eyes of their faithe, &amp; loke vpon him which is the ſonne of God, and God him ſelf. Which thing, to the end you ſhould the better beléeue it, it was propheſied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Prophet Eſay, that is: that the Iewes ſhould bothe fall away from Chriſt, &amp; that they ſhould afterwards come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to him by repentance. The one, we haue already ſéene to haue chanced, whereof the thing it ſelfe beareth witneſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prophet ſaide not amiſſe: And the other we ought to looke for, which is yet moſte certainly to come. For thus ſayeth the Prophet: There ſhal come out of Sion, he that dothe deliuer, and ſhall turn away the vngodlineſſe of Iacob:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 13. Eſay. 59.</note> And this is my couenant with them, when I ſhall take away theyr ſinnes. God made once a couenaunt with the ſame nation: which, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hathe in déede made it, he will not ſuffer it to be done in vaine, or for no purpoſe: but aſſuredly to take effecte, euen through the occaſion of ſome mennes faultes, which do ſhewe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:26975:60"/> themſelues vnworthy the good promiſſes of God. Howebeit, there ſhall alwayes be ſome, which ſhall ſupplie the roume of the whole nation. Neither can we ſay, that they haue gonne ſo farre from the grace of God, that they cannot returne againe. Al they which cleane and ſticke faſte to the letter and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the lawe, and haue caſt from them the goſpel of Chriſt, be very enemies vnto God. But to the end therfore, you ſhould not taunt or raile vpon them, God would that the thing which is ſo done, ſhould be to all your commodities: in as muche, as they caſting away the goſpel of Chriſt, the ſame the ſooner toke place with you. But all they, for as muche as they be borne of holy parents, &amp; do alſo appertaine vnto that nation, which God from all others choſe to him ſelfe for his owne proper people:<note place="margin">The Iewes dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God for their parents ſake.</note> by vertue of whoſe parents, they be yet dearly beloued of God: It ſhall folowe, that the ſame ſhall the ſooner be receiued vnto grace againe, if they ſhall happily fall to repentance: and ſhall alſo the ſooner be made partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſſes of God (made héeretofore to their fathers) which at this preſent time, all we do preache. For verily, God doth not make his promiſſes after ſuch a ſorte (either doth entende any thing) that he may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes repent himſelfe thereof, and thereuppon to chaunge his minde and purpoſe, as the common cuſtome of men is to doe: but he is alwayes immutable: which, as he cannot erre and do amiſſe: euen ſo he cannot repent himſelf of any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth. God wil remember his promiſſe vnto the Iewes,<note place="margin">Gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beraunce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iewes.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo euer he ſhall ſée them turne to him againe, &amp; caſt him no more away from them. Al things haue their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and alteration: therfore ye ought not to ieſt vppon the miſerable Iewes that be fallen from God: ſpecially, bicauſe the ſame was commodious &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto you. Againe,<note place="margin">Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> if they do repent and come vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you ſhould gratifie them in their ſo doing. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that all you were once vnfaithfull (as many of the Iewes be in theſe dayes:) yet did not God forſake you for euer fith it is brought to paſſe at this time, through his great mercie and goodneſſe, that in their ſteade (bicauſe they did reiecte theyr faith in Chriſte) you were thereunto receiued.</p>
               <p>And thus God ſuffered the Iewes to fall from the faith for
<pb facs="tcp:26975:61"/> a ſpace, vntill ſuche time as the Gentiles mighte haue theyr prepared pathes to come vnto it. So that, after their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and comming againe to God (at his appoynted time when he ſhall call them) they ſhall obtaine the lyke mercie with you:<note place="margin">The Iewes and the Gentiles ioined in one faith to Chriſt.</note> and neither of you ſhall caſte the other in the téethe with the others enormities, but bothe of you ſhal gratefie one an other, that you haue all receyued ſemblable mercie at the handes of almightie God: which dothe order and diſpoſe all things with ſuche an vnſpeakeable wiſedome and councell: that all men (what ſo euer they be) are found ſubiect to ſinne,<note place="margin">God not being the author of ſinne why he ſuffereth men to fal into ſin</note> and lacke of beléefe. Not that he him ſelf is the author &amp; cauſer therof, but that he ſuffereth them to fall into it throughe their owne fault and malice, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the ſame for a ſpace: to the ende, that thereby perceiuing the goodneſſe of God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and their owne vnkindeneſſe and faulte alſo in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they may be occaſioned to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe at the laſt with open mouth, that they be not ſaued &amp; brought to ſaluation by their owne deſeruings, but by the gratuitie &amp; only mercie of God, throughe his ſonne Chriſte: leaſte they (in their pride) ſhould blindely boaſt them ſelues, and glory in their owne ſtrength and vertue.<note place="margin">God beeing cleere of mans fall turneth the ſame to good.</note> And thoughe God, in this manner worketh theſe things amongſt men: yet he him ſelfe is ſo farre from the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or conſenting of any mannes fall into ſinne or vice, that he in moſte miraculous manner, and farre paſſing the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, turneth that thing which is naught in ſome, vnto others great weale &amp; commoditie.

Agayne, as the ſame is giuen
<pb facs="tcp:26975:63"/> him of God for his faythes ſake: ſo he would not he ſhould therewith magnifie and extoll him ſelfe: but that he ſhould wholly employ it to the comforte and profite of hys poore and néedy neighbour.

Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, that he may helpe to ſuſtayne his poore and néedy neighbours with his goodes and riches: let him employ the ſame to their neceſſities, with all gladneſſe, méekeneſſe, and ſoberneſſe. If he haue the gifte of knowledge and learning, let him not be ſcornefull towards the vnlearned: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all kinde of arrogancie, let him vſe it vnto them, to their godly inſtruction and edifying. If he haue the gifte of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or to perſuade men to leade an honeſt and a godly life, according to the Scriptures, let him execute the ſame with all diligence and godly loue. Either, whether he haue the gifte of worldly wealth, let him therewith ſuccour all mankinde: and let him ſhew him ſelfe frendly and beneficial

Alſo, whether he be moued to helpe and ſuccour the miſerable and carefull people, let him not do it with any ſad or ſullen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (which may be an occaſion that the man whom he ſo helpeth, be the rather daſht out of countenance, &amp; therby his care much more encreaſed, bicauſe he ſhal think that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helpe commeth not to him voluntarily &amp; of glad good wil) but from an hart not perfectly charitable, &amp; ſo rather hath his helpe for maner ſake, or for an outward cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance to the world, than for godly dutie, or by the fréedome of charitie. Againe let him not in any caſe caſt the good dede that he hath done in the teth of the poore, when he is ſo releeued: for ſurely that vice is far paſſing either al godly or manlike nature. We are not of god caſt in the teeth with his innumerable benefits beſtowed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon vs, but he always &amp; continually allureth vs to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, by renuing his bleſſings bountifully vpon vs, though we be altogither moſt vnworthy of them.

For to obſerue them amongeſt men that are perfecte, it is greatly repugning the will of God and the holy Goſpell.

For the diſputation or queſtioning about theſe matters, let not the Chriſtian concord be broken amongeſt you in any caſe: but let euery man (for the tyme) follow his owne iudgement, and not condemne any other mans opinion: inaſmuche as either of the parties may be without offence: &amp; in either of them a time of perfection may be ſéene, to grow to true vnderſtanding and godlyneſſe.

Alſo he that maketh difference of dayes, if he doo erre therin, he erreth vnto his Lord, and it maketh no matter at all vnto thée. Further, he that without ſcrupuloſitie eateth of all kinds of meats, the ſame alſo eateth for the Lords plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: inaſmuche as he therfore giueth thanks vnto him, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough whoſe onely benefite he eateth, and through whoſe gracious benignitie al things are created for the vſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

Wherin, if God ſhall allow and accept his thanks, what haſt thou then to do with him for it? The cauſe of this matter is not one, but the matter it ſelfe is one, and the minde is one, and the Lorde alſo is one. This man is thankfull to God for his bountifull goodneſſe, hauing libertie by him to eate what him liſt, and that bicauſe the law of the Goſpell maketh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a difference and choyſe of our minds, than it dothe of meats.

One Chriſtian man hath no further to doo with another, but onely to profite one another.<note place="margin">The whole duty of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Neither dothe any man liue his owne ſeruaunte, or properly to him ſelfe, conſidering wée be all ſeruauntes to the Lorde, which hathe boughte vs from vyce to godlyneſſe, and from death vnto lyfe.

Thus then, if the ſeruaunt liue, he liueth not for his owne pleaſure and honour, but onely for the Lords honour, or otherwiſe for his diſhonour. Which, if he dye, he doth it alſo to fulfill the wil of the Lorde. Wherefore, whether he liue or dye, if the Lordes will therein bée doone, it commeth of him ſelfe, and not of thée, neither will he therfore chalenge any thing at thy hand.

Thou that art ſuperſtitious, how dareſt thou be ſo bold to iudge him that is ſtronger than thou thy ſelf? which eateth without any queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al kind of meats and vſeth al daies alike in the ſeruice of god? or elſe, thou that art ſtrong, why dareſt thou haue thy brother in contempte that is weaker than thou thy ſelfe? as though a man woulde ſay, that thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe rather his Lorde, than felowe ſeruant with him?

But if we ſhall iudge any thing at all, let vs then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudge howe one of vs may helpe and ſuccoure an other: and howe we may heere liue in this tranſitorie life, that we may giue none occaſion of euill or filthie liuing, and ſo one to offend an other. Let vs helpe to lift vp the weake, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither to throw him downe. And let vs touſe vp the ſmokie flare, and not vtterly quench it out. The manner of authoritie and dignitie requireth, that the learned man do obey vnto the ignorant: not to the end he ſhould conſent vnto his erroure or offence, but that he might by little and little amende him, or elſe at the leaſte wiſe he ſhould not muche offend him by the roughneſſe or boyſteouſneſſe of his language. For taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my ſelfe: Moſes in time paſſed, appoynted out certen kinde of meates as vncleane, which he properly called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: the which to eate, it was not lawfull to any man. And ſome he appoynted out as cleane, which all men might lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eate. Howebeit, I am nowe well aſſured, thorow the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God (which will that the carnall lawe of Moſes be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed) that there is nothing vncleane of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither is there reſpectes of meates among the faithfull.<note place="margin">1. Corin. 8.</note> Therfore, if ther be any thing vncleane, the ſame is vncleane only vnto him, which thinketh it ſo to be: that is to ſay, to the weake and ſuperſtitious it is vncleane: but to the ſtrong and
<pb facs="tcp:26975:74"/> perfect in Chriſt, there is nothing vncleane, but all things be cleane, yet for al that, it ſhalbe very expedient, ſomtime to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from that thing, which of his owne nature is cleane: not bicauſe the law of Moſes ſo commaundeth it, but bicauſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly charitie ſo requireth it: which only thing, is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men cheefely to be reſpected. Wherefore, if thy brothers hart be perplexed &amp; hurt through the occaſion of thy meat (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which, ſeeing he was of ſo great eſtimation with Chriſt him ſelfe (whom alſo thou moſt dearely loueſt) then ſhouldeſt thou for his ſake, not ſo lightly regarde him, but loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for thou art his brother: neither maiſt thou think it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inough, if the thing be right which thou doeſt: but thou muſt alſo haue good reſpect, that the ſame thing which is right of it ſelf, be not in ſuch maner ordered, that it cary therewith any ſuſpection of euill: neither the thing which is good to thée, be turned to the preiudice of another man. But ſpecially I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, that there be not perceiued amongſt you, any fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical or contentious opinions: namely about meats &amp; drinks, or for other the like trifling things: for like as in the world to come (in the kingdome of God) there ſhalbe neither meat nor drinke (which bothe at this preſent time, we haue by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, to the relieuement and ſuccoring of al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And what things be they? verily, rightuouſneſſe, peace, and ioy. Which come not vnto vs by the obſeruation of meates and drinkes, but by the holy ghoſte him ſelf. The diſceptation or diſputing about meates, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth hatred and diſſention: it engendreth ſorow: it enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth offence, &amp; occaſioneth much quarelling. But the vertue of the holy ghoſt, in ſtead of diſſention, engendreth peace: for ſorow, ioyfulneſſe: and for offence and iniurie, charitie and Chriſten méekeneſſe. For as it is the office of iuſtice,<note place="margin">Iuſtice.

But they ſerue Chriſt in ſpirite, which do not defend their owne opinions and déedes for the beſt: but through cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie méekely obey vnto others, &amp; are made for all things to al men, that vnto godlineſſe they may win al men: and do alſo in ſuch maner temper them ſelues, that they may pleaſe &amp; agrée with all men. All we therfore that are ſpirituall,<note place="margin">To be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded is to ſeeke peace.</note> ſetting apart al vaine diſputations, let vs folow thoſe things that make for peace, concord, mutuall loue and charitie: that therby we may the better be framed, one of vs to ſuccor an other, &amp; in no wiſe to giue occaſion of offence: for ſuch is our calling, and the very perfect rule of our Chriſten profeſſion. Thou therefore, vnto whom God hath giuen ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; the liuely gift of faith, do not y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſo offend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for thy meat ſake, the work of God be deſtroyed: but let rather thy meat be deſtroyed &amp; turned to naught, than by occaſion therof y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing ſhuld periſh and be turned to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, that God ſo preciouſly bought by the blud of his déere ſon.

Be thou wel aſſured, that I do right wel allow thy faith and godly ſtrength, whereby thou ſetteſt at naughte the choiſe of meates: but yet I would haue thée to kéepe the ſame cloſe and ſecrete vnto thy ſelfe, if it ſhall happen thée to eſpie thy brother in daunger, or thereby to be offended: for it ſhal be only ſufficient vnto thée (the time conſidered) to remember that God héerein taketh in good parte, thy Chriſten ſtrengthe and aſſurance: yet the ſame is to be diſſimuled for a ſpace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thou ſhuldeſt beware, leaſt thou offend thy neighbor: wher otherwiſe thou oughteſt wholely to applie thy ſtrength to ſuſtaine and beare with the weakeneſſe of him. And before all things thou muſte diligently take héede, that in ſetting at
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26975:75"/> naught the difference of meats, through thy might &amp; ſtrength which thou in thy perfection vſeſt, that this thy ſtrength, be the ſtrength rather of thy conſcience, and not of fulfilling thy pleaſure. And in reprehending alſo an other, for his apparant ſuperſtition or abſtinence from meates: thou maiſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be doutfull of thy ſelfe, or not well perſuaded by faith: but thou muſt do it of perfect ſtrengthe, leaſt thou appeare rather ſtronger in woordes, than chriſtianly ſtrong in faith. Bleſſed is he that hath ſuch ſtrength of faith in his hart, that his owne conſcience doth not ſecretly control him for that thing, which he defendeth and openly alloweth vnto others: or that it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely condemne him not, in the cloſette of his breſt, for ſuche things as he proteſteth abrode only in his wordes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. For he that eateth, and yet doubteth, whether it be lawfull or not to be eaten, he is certainly of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a condemned man. And why is he therby in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience condemned? Verily, bicauſe that the thing which he doth, procéedeth not rightly from the might of true faithe and conſtancie, or from an harte that of it ſelfe is cleane, but of a corrupted conſcience and an vncleane hart: which one way in woord ſecretly alloweth, and otherwiſe openly in déede repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. For what ſo euer procéedeth not of faithe,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> the ſame can not be without ſinne, but offence greatly committed before the face of God. For when a man doth a thing, that of it ſelf is not euil, but yet douteth therof whether it be euil or not, then he declareth plainly of him ſelf (if he do it in his doutfulneſſe) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit that thing (euen wilfully of malice) that is woorthily noted wicked and euil. Surely, perfect &amp; vndouted godlineſſe, baniſheth cleane from it, all ſuche things as haue in them but only a bare péece &amp; ſimilitude of euill. Thus, he that without regard, careleſly offendeth through his malice, is woorthy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharpely to be reprehended: And he alſo that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him ſelfe to be amended, is of the godly to be refuſed, &amp; as an enimie to be ſhaken off and auoided. But if his error come only of weakeneſſe, and not of malice: then is he woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the more charitably to be taught and reformed, and not to be refuſed, diſdained, or once laughed to ſcorne.</p>

Let no man therefore, in the good gifte that is giuen vnto him of God, pleaſe ſimply him ſelfe therin, as though he had receiued it at his hande, to ſet forth therwith his owne pride and vanitie: but rather let him trade him ſelfe héerein: that is: that he learne to abaſe him ſelfe, to deſpiſe his own hautie and ſtout courage, to pleaſe his neighbor in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and in godly obedience to ſéeke his daily edifying.

Vnto the Iewes he ſhewed his obedience, to the ende, he wold in all his actes ſet foorth the truth of his father, which ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he wold truly performe that thing to the poſteritie, whiche he promiſed to their elders, by the holy oracles and ſaying of the Prophets that among themſelues they mighte be ioyfull and glad, ſeeing they haue now receiued the truthe it ſelfe, which Moyſes before declared, ſhould come in his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures &amp; ſimilitudes.<note place="margin">The mercye of God in Chryſt towardes the Gentiles.</note> And to the Gentiles whiche had nothing at al promiſed vnto them, he became alſo obedient and kinde, to the end that all they through the only mercy of God, and his owne moſt painfull deſerts, were brought from their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death vnto the moſt pleaſaunt life, ioy and ſaluation.

Theſe things I ſpeake vnto you, not as one that doubteth of you, feareth you to be faynte, or colde in the right vſe of vertue: for I am well aſſured, that (among many vertues) ye are all ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with the noble vertue of charitie, and with the gifte of perfecte knowledge among your ſelues: whereby you are all able, one of you ſufficiently to inſtructe another herein, without néedefull trauell of any other teacher. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I did the more boldely write this ſame vnto you, not reſpecting herein any iuſte cauſe of your ignorance, or as though my ſeruice were now offered vnto you as vnto vnwilling receiuers: but onely to admoniſh you, what thing moſte principally you ought to doo, according to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as vertuouſe and well doers, and that voluntarily, and of your own frée motions: yet that ye might the rather from hencefoorth, muche more copiouſly worke the ſame, at mine

The which thing, inaſmuche as I ſee it already come to paſſe in you, I may of good righte bée gladde, yet not in boaſting my ſelfe therefore among men, but to reioyce onely in God, for the good and proſperous ſucceſſe which I haue of my preaching: and not imputing the ſame vnto mine owne induſtrie &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,<note place="margin">Acts. 3: 2.

Neither will I in this behalfe become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any other: for I haue not preached the Goſpell of Chryſt, as the common ſorte vſe to doo: that is, euer in one place: but vntill this preſent houre, I haue preached in thoſe Regions (moſte ſpecially) where the name of Chryſt was not before ſpoken of: yea, and for the furthering of Gods onely glory and prayſe, I haue deſired helpe at hys holy hande, that the foundation of the Chriſtian Religion, mighte be caſte into a greater compaſſe, and that the limites of his moſte worthy renoume might more amply be ſpredde and ſtretched foorthe abroade vppon the whole earth. For which cauſe, as I thoughte it not beſte to buylde vppon the foundation of the other Apoſtles: bicauſe, euen as it is a more difficill and harde thing, firſt to appoynte and limitte the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Religion, than well to repayre and kéepe the ſame in ſafetie, which is already begonne: euen ſo, I thought it muche better to make for the progreſſion of the Goſpell, to preache the name of Chryſt in ſuche places onely, as none of the Apoſtles yet came vnto: namely, foraſmuche as I perceiued the ſame thing to haue bene prophecied long before by the moſte holy Prophet Eſaias, which ſaith: They that of him had nothing declared vnto them, they ſhal yet ſee:<note place="margin">Eſay. 52.</note> and they that hard not yet of him, ſhall alſo vnderſtand. And this ſame ardente deſire within me, to ſet foorth the chriſtian fayth &amp; religion, was the only cauſe that hath hitherto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me from you, though no man could more hartily haue wiſhed to be with you, than I my ſelfe haue done. Therfore, ſéeing I haue now in ſuch ſort ranged ouer all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis of Achaia &amp; Macedonia, that I ſée therein no place lefte, which is deſtitute of the knowledge of Chryſt, or in which I haue not alredy laide the fundation of the chriſtian faith and religion: and foraſmuche alſo as I haue wyſhed moſt gladly many yeres ſince, for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time to ſée you, I truſt now
<pb facs="tcp:26975:79"/> ſhortely to haue occaſion happily giuen vnto me, to ſatiſfie in this poynt my glad deſire towards you. Wherfore, when I ſhall paſſe on my iourney towards the countrey of Spayne, I will take you in my way, and ſo remayne with you vntill ſuche time as I ſhall ſomewhat haue ſatiſfied my minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt you, in vſing moſte ioyfully your chriſtian and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company. Which thing, I truſt ſhal ſhortly come to paſſe, if it be the good will of Chryſt: and that from thence I ſhall moſt gladly deſire you to accompany me on my way, and to guide me into Spayne. But at this preſent, I doo you to wit, I am taking my iourney towards the Citie Ieruſalem: there to diſtribute vnto the neceſſitie of the chriſtian Iewes &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chryſt, the bountifull liberalitie of the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Achaians, which they haue committed vnto my charge to bée doone.<note place="margin">Acts. 11. 1. Corin. 16. 2. Corin. 8.9.</note> For to that ende and purpoſe, it hathe ſo pleaſed their godly mindes, to make a collection of money throughoute the whole Countreys: declaring thereby the fruites of their change and perfection, to the reioycing of the poore chriſtian brethren at Ieruſalem: which, although they haue not among them ſelues the vſe of worldly ſuſtentation, or wante things ſufficiente to relieue their poore and néedie bodies: yet touching their riches and reliefe which they haue in Chryſt, through their perfection in Religion, that is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wonderfull, large, and ineſtimable. In conſideration whereof, and bicauſe they firſte receiued from them, and by their teſtimonies, their entraunce and beginning into chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: they thought them ſelues (of duetie) great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounde vnto them, and to beſtow fréely and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement vpon them, that which I doo moſt worthily allow, which is, their very bountifull and chriſtian beneuolence. Therefore, conſidering I ſay, that they which be now at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, did firſte worke the meanes that the doctrine of Chriſt deſcended vnto the Gentiles: It is now reaſon alſo, that the Gentiles in like maner doo miniſter vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26975:79"/> and without all charge communicated vnto them the effecte and full ſumme of their whole health and ſaluation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſoone as I (according to good order and duetie) ſhall haue diſcharged mine handes of this their ſayde chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence (which without commoditie to my ſelfe I fréely receiued, and will as fréely deliuer it them) I will take my iourney into Spayne. And although I haſten forwardes my ſelfe as muche as I poſſibly may vntill I bée in Spayne, to preache therein the Goſpell of Chryſt: yet for all that it repenteth mée not, in this maner for a whyle to be ſtayed from thence. And when ſoeuer I ſhall come vnto Rome to ſée you, I doubte not but my comming amongeſt you ſhall greatly further the glory of Chryſt: In as muche as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by the godly inclination of your heartes, you will all be maruellous gladde of my companie: whiche hytherto (through the deuine helpe of God) haue doone all things for you, according to your gentle deſires. Notwithſtanding, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can not bée preſently with you, or ſo ſoone as I would wiſhe to bée: I ſhall therefore in the meane whyle, hartily require you all, euen for the loue of our Lord Ieſus Chryſt,<note place="margin">Paule earneſtli requeſteth the Romains to pray for him</note> and for your charities ſake in him, that you will pray vnto God for me: that through the contemplation of your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and godly prayers, I may happily bée deliuered from the handes of the vnhappie and faythleſſe Iewes, and from ſo many vexations as I abyde amongeſt them: leaſt perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture in preaching the Goſpell, any parte of the fruites thereof ſhoulde not bée ſuffered to paſſe foorth according to the will of God: and that alſo my Commiſſion for the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the beneuolence, may ſo be finiſhed and ended, that there may be no occaſion found of any mans grudging or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietouſneſſe. And further, that after the great multitude of my troubles héere in Iewry, I may the more merily come vnto you that be at Rome, there to recreate and comfort my ſelfe amongeſt you. And thus to ende myne exhortation vnto you (as I beganne at the firſte) I hartily pray vnto God (which is the true Author and Parente of all peace and concord,<note place="margin">1.

For howſoeuer we call him good and mercifull, yet are we compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to acknowledge him to be iuſt alſo. Neither ſhoulde it bée truely good that lacked iuſtice. Now that his iuſtice alſo might continue inuiolate, and yet man, which doth nothing worthy of iuſtice, ſhould not euer be depriued of his companie, he found a way, by the which both his iuſtice ſhould be ſatiſfied, and the poore miſer reſtored again to the company of God.

               <note place="margin">Zwingly.</note>I am glad that this place is laide againſt me, and ſpecially for this cauſe, that the variation of the couenaunte (which is found in many places of the ſcriptures) may be a little excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Couenaunt, as in this pointe, is nothing elſe than a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promiſed of God. As when the Lord ſtroke a bargaine or couenaunt with Abraham.<note place="margin">Gene. 17.</note> I am God almightie (ſaythe he) walke before me and be perfecte, and I wil put my couenant betweene me &amp; thée, and betwéene thy ſéede after thée in their generations, with an euerlaſting couenant, that I be thy god, and the God of thy ſéede after thee. And I will giue to thée and to thy ſéede after thee, the land of thy Pilgrimage, and all the land of Canaan in poſſeſſion for euer, and I will be thy God. Héere is nothing ſpoken but the couenaunte, which God (by fauoure) vouchedſafe to make with Abraham. But what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth this couenaunte? With what conditions is it made? Theſe be then the conditions, I will be thy God. Thou ſhalt walke before me, moſte purely. I will make thée a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations, I will géeue the ſéede of Sara.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:26975:84"/>
            <p>And I wil be the God of that poſteritie of thine alſo, which I promiſe. I will giue to thée and to thy ſéede, the lande, in the which thou art now a ſtranger. The which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, be euen the very couenaunte ſelfe. But to the couenauntes are added ſignes. Which althoughe they be called by the names of the couenaunts, be not the couenaunts for all that, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the ſame place. For it foloweth on this wiſe. This is my couenant that thou ſhalt kéepe betwéene me and thee, and thy ſéede after thée. Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childe of you be circumciſed. Sée howe he calleth the circumciſion the couenaunte. When for all that it was not the couenant, but the ſigne of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, euen as the diuine ſaying it ſelfe teacheth on this wiſe: And yée ſhal circumciſe the fleſhe of your foreſkin, that it may be a token or ſigne betwéene me and you. We ſée it to be now called the ſigne of the couenaunt, which a little before was called the couenaunt. It is therefore euident inoughe, that the ſignes of the couenaunts, be not the couenants, although they haue ſometimes the names of the couenaunts put vpon them. As when circumciſion is héere called the couenant, wheras it is yet but the ſigne of the couenaunt. And Baptiſme. 1. Pet. 3. is taken for Chriſt, when he ſaythe that we are ſaued by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, yet are we ſaued by only Chriſt. This is the text of S. Peter: When the long ſuffering of God, was once loked for, in the dayes of Noe, while the Arke was a preparing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe, that is to ſay, eight ſoules were ſaued by the water, like as Baptiſme nowe ſaueth vs: Not the putting away the filthe of the fleſhe, but in that a good conſcience conſenteth to God, by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuinglie expoundeth this place in his ſubſidie or helpe as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth: vve thought it not neceſſary to repeat any further thoſe things vvhich vve broughte in our commentarie: for vve truſte that vve haue ſatiſfied them that be godly, and ſomevvhat more grovvne in the faithe, vvhich commit them ſelfe to Chriſt in this floud that drovvneth this vvorlde, none othervviſe then Noe did in the olde time committe him ſelfe and his, and the remnaunts of the vvhole vovrld that forthvvith shuld be deſtroyed, to that greate shippe, as men borne after the deathe of their father.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26975:85"/>
            <p>
               <hi>For they that put their confidence in Chriſte, require Chriſte no more according to the fleshe, for they knovve that fleshe profiteth nothing, as is vvritten in the ſixth of Ihon, if thou eate it: but then knovv that it profiteth much, if thou beleeue Chriſt to be ſlaine for thee in the fleshe, And that thou put thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in that. In this vvinde they ſvvimme ſafely to land. In this shippe they are ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Baptiſme is as well the ſigne of the Chriſtian people which haue receiued of God this couenaunt, that his ſonne is oures. As the Circumciſion was in the olde time the ſigne of this couenaunt, that the Lorde would be their God, and they ſhould be his people. We wil nowe paſſe ouer from the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or teſtament of Abraham, to Chriſtes couenant or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. The couenant that was made with Abraham, is ſo ſtrong, and not to be abrogated, that on leſſe a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kéepe it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, he ſhall not be a Chriſtian or faithfull man. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord be thy God, and thou the ſeruaunts of him only (for thou ſhalt woorſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerue) there is no cauſe why thou ſhuldeſt boaſt thy ſelfe to be a chriſtian man. But he whom thou ſo worſhippeſt and ſerueſt, is ſo thy God, (that is to ſay) thy higheſt good, that he giueth himſelf fréely to thée, that he caſteth away himſelf vnto deathe for thée, that he might reconcile thée to him ſelfe. He which hath performed it,<note place="margin">Take this for both ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that is to ſay, Baptime and the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for both are but fleſh touching the extern vſe.</note> promiſed this grace long ſince, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our father tranſgreſſed his lawe, and after that, he euer renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that promiſſe to the fathers. There was none other cauſe why he promiſed it, but bicauſe that bleſſedneſſe coulde not happen vnto vs, although we endeuored and labored for it til we ſwet againe, till the fall of oure firſt father were forgiuen and ſatiſfied. But when Chriſte being now offered for vs, had pacified the diuine iuſtice in ſuche ſorte, that by him only a man might goe vnto God. Nowe hath God made a newe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt with mankinde. Not ſo newe a couenant, as though he had hardly or ſkarcely found this remedie at the laſte, but bicauſe that whereas he had long a goe prepared it, he gaue it when the time was come.</p>
            <p>This new couenant then or teſtament, is the fré<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26975:85"/> forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which God hath liberally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his ſon. They therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truſt to God by Chryſt, &amp; doo bring their children to that truſt and fayth (for wée muſte adde that withall) as Abraham and his poſteritie in old time was circumciſed, ſo are they circumciſed: but with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chryſt, which is baptiſme.<note place="margin">Colloſ 2.</note> Baptiſme therefore tendeth euen to the ſame effect that Circumciſion dyd in the olde tyme: for it is the ſigne of the couenaunt that God hath made with vs by his ſonne. Baptiſme then is the chéefe and principall ſigne of the new Teſtament or couenaunt. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how that Couenaunt is made perfect, the celebration of the Lordes Supper, bringeth vs in remembraunce thereof. Not ſurely that the Supper is the Couenaunt, but bicauſe the Couenaunt is brought to memorie in it, and that thanks be giuen to the Lorde for ſo liberall a benefite. What is then the new Couenaunt? Frée remiſſion of ſinnes by the ſonne of God. Thereof it commeth, that foraſmuche as this frée remiſſion of ſinnes is obtayned by the death and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding foorth of the bloud of Chryſt, the ſame death and bloud may peraduenture be called the Couenaunt. Although if a man ſpeake truely and properly, Chryſt is not the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, but the mediator of the newe Teſtamente. As Paule ſpeaketh, for the very couenaunt is,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.</note> the remiſſion of ſinnes. Notwithſtanding, wée will not theſe things to be ſpoken ſo farre foorth, as though wée thought it a faulte, if the death of Chryſt, or his bloud ſhould be called the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt: but for the intente louingly to ſtirre vp theſe raſhe felowes (that loue to ſtriue with wordes) to the cleare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Now let vs goe further. Chryſt would that the memorie of his benefite (which he perfourmed with ſo bitter death) ſhould euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ée in full ſtrength among vs. Wherevppon he not without cauſe, inſtituted the frequentation alſo of the remiſſion of ſinnes, none otherwiſe then he did once inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the celebritie of the deliueraunce out of the Egyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bondage. Now ſéeing that the bloud of the Couenaunte may be called the Couenaunt, and that we in this celebritie
<pb facs="tcp:26975:86"/> or aſſembly, doo giue thanks for the bloud that is ſhed, by the which the Couenaunt is finiſhed vp and made perfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it alſo commeth, that we call it the bloud of Chryſt. By the which, wée onely make commemoration, that the bloud was and is ſhed for vs. And then euen as wée haue called the bloud, the Couenaunt, ſo wée name the ſigne or token alſo of the bloud ſhed, the Couenaunt. Say all this to be but an olde wiues tale, except the words of the Apoſtle proue it. That the remiſſion of ſinnes is the very couenaunt, Paule teacheth,<note place="margin">Hebr. 8.</note> That this teſtament, couenaunt, or bargayne is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by the bloud and death of Chryſt. Peter giueth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.3:</note> And Paule to the Colloſ. 1. Furthermore, none of the Apoſtles calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death or bloud, the couenant, but the bloud of the couenaunt. Notwithſtanding, wée leaue it to a mans libertie, for inſtructions ſake: that they may be called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt. Reherſe the Apoſtles words, and marke them wel. If then, the bloud it ſelfe which was ſhed, is not called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, but the bloud of the couenaunt (as by which the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of frée remiſſion is obteined and confirmed) how much more is this Cuppe of the bloud, not the couenaunt, but a ſigne and token of the bloud of the couenaunt? The ſigne therfore hath receiued the name of the thing ſignified, as it is aboue euidently ſhewed. The Sacrament therfore of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt and teſtament (if a man take Sacramente for the principall and externe ſigne of the couenaunt or promiſe) is baptiſme. But of the paſſion of Chryſt (by which this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt or teſtament is perfourmed) this aſſembly is the ſigne, in the which the bread and wine are deuided in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chryſtes death, with thankes giuing of the faythfull, béeing all of one accorde. Héere we ought not to be ſo impotent, to braule ſo ſtiffely about the name, whyleſt one will haue this aſſembly of thankes giuing to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and another denieth it. For when we vnderſtande the thing it ſelfe clerely, why ſtriue we yet about what name we ſhall call it.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS A GENERAL</hi> propoſition, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth the one parte of the ſtate of this ſermon: namely that al things vnder the ſunne are vayne. But euen now a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is here offred, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of this matter of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what thinges they be which here of Salomon are numbred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vaine thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: whether onely man with his cares and worldly deſires, or elſe whether he putteth other things alſo vnder va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie, as are the elements, and things growen &amp; concrete of them. The definition of this word vaine, ſhal ſolue eaſily the queſtion, if a man ſhew what the ſcripture properly meneth by this word <hi>Habel:</hi> that is vaine, ſuperfluous &amp; fooliſh. Thoſe men which hold only man to be here counted vaine with his counſels &amp; life, they may allege two reaſons for them ſelues. One is, conſidering that man as the head, giueth the cauſe of vanitie to the reſt of al things, as ſhal hereafter more plainly appers. The other reaſon is, for ſomuch as they which taught that the inferiour creatures were here of Salomon reputed vaine, mingled therewithal corrupted doctrines, as to eſchue thoſe creatures which god had made good, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe &amp; ſeruice of man. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore blameth their mind which follow this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to deliuer mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great an error, and to reſtore the works of God to their ryghte vſe: ſo that they graunt onely man to be vayne: that is to ſay, man to be chiefly vaine, but the reſte to be all vaine in man, and
<pb facs="tcp:26975:87"/> by man. For elſe vayne ſhall be taken for the vanitie of ſinne onely, and neither of Salomon, nor in all the Scripture to be applied to onely man, corrupted with naughtie deſires. For Salomon in this and other his Bookes, reputeth all things vnder the ſunne to be but vayne: and expreſſely pronounceth youth or adoleſcencie (afterwards in this ſame Booke, and in the Prouerbes) alſo beautie to be but vayne,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 3 1.</note> which are yet the good creatures of God. After the ſame ſorte the Apoſtle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the creature vnder vanitie,<note place="margin">Roma. 8.</note> in theſe wordes: For the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lieth ſubiecte vnder vanitie. Which is an argument, that vayne is not alwayes repugnaunt to good, but oftentimes to firmitie and ſtableneſſe. Héerevnto agréeth, that Salomon, when he would approue all things to be vayne, taketh his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not of euill which is ſinne, but of condition ſlipping to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when he addeth héere this: A generation paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and a generation commeth. Likewiſe in the ende, when he had rightly expreſſed the image of the dying man. He héere rehearſeth this ſentence, which he heere proponeth, vanitie of vanities, occaſion of that acclamation taken, not of ſinne, but of frayle nature. Suche as Dauid tooke likewiſe, when he ſayth:<note place="margin">Pſalm. 3 8.</note> Man to be vayne, for ſo muche as he is mortall and of ſhort life, vſing there alſo this word <hi>Habel:</hi> and is opponed in that place, and ſet agaynſt the ſureneſſe of nature, and not agaynſt the goodneſſe of righteouſneſſe, as witneſſeth bothe that which goeth before, and foloweth in the texte. For it is before: Lo, thou haſt made my dayes in a meaſure: and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidi,</hi> that is, mine age is nothing in thy ſight. In like maner alſo it foloweth: But man walketh in an image. In which vanitie of ſlipping life, are included alſo al other liuing things. For after in the thirde Chapter, it is ſayde: Beaſtes haue the ſame chaunce that men haue: where alſo it is read: So that there is one deſtruction of Man and Beaſtes, and equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them both: euen as man dyeth, ſo doo they. Likewiſe Dauid ſayth: Thou ſhalte take their ſpirite from them, and they ſhall decay and returne into their duſte.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 103.</note> It is therefore manyfeſt, that <hi>Habel</hi> firſt and chiefly noteth thoſe things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſinnes, that is, the nature voyd of God, whoſe thoughts
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26975:87"/> and counſels his ſpirit enformeth not. In that ſort is Sathan onely vayne with the wicked. Of this vanitie ſpeaketh Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid euery where in the Pſalmes, and Salomon in his booke of Eccleſiaſtes, where the friuolous counſels and thoughts of the vayne hart of man, are taxed and reproued. This vanitie is the ſpring head, and beginner of vanitie in the reſte, as hereafter ſhall appeare. Secondly, that is taken for vayne which periſheth, and admitteth courſes to be borne, and to dye, holding determined ſpaces of their continuaunce. In this ſorte it is vſurped both in this booke, and alſo in other: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is aboue therin recited. And ſo are thoſe things vaine, which are compacte togither of the ſoluble coniunction of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thirdly, vaine is it which ſuſtaineth any maner of change, being of his nature able to be moued, either to better or to worſe. So are all creatures partakers of their vanitie, as wel they that be aboue, as they alſo that be beneath: aſwel the heauenly, as al they that be vnder heauen. In this maner are al ſtrange gods called <hi>Habelei</hi> generally, both in Moyſes &amp; in the bookes of Kings, vnto which a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth himſelf beſides one only god, which made both heuen &amp; earth: bicauſe that god is voyd of al changing, being the inuariable &amp; chefeſt goodneſſe: in whom only it is conuenient for man to reſt with faith &amp; loue: other thing there is none at al, for al other things for ſo muche as they were made of nothing, they ſuffer ſome motion, wherby they may come to better: be it of nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſtable to eternitie, &amp; to continue for euer. Furthermore Angels being a worke created of naught,<note place="margin">Aungells.</note> haue likewiſe their power &amp; motion: power, able to be made perfect, motion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them perfect: whether a man conſider the power of God at the light of nature (which light hath alſo his degrées of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) or elſe at the light ſupernatural. For them alſo doth the vnapprocheable light of god bring from the darkneſſe of nature, into his wonderfull light: for they are dayly lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe things which chaunce to the Church in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the croſſe by Chryſt,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note> the Apoſtle witneſſeth to the Epheſians, and obtayne their glory alſo with the children of the kingdome, whom they ſerue. For as they were made of
<pb facs="tcp:26975:88"/> nothing: ſo haue they their <hi>Tohu va Vohu:</hi> that is, their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; imperfection: their darknes alſo which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſeth about this imperfection, to be wiped away by the light of god, which light ſheweth it ſelf among thoſe dark miſtes, by the ſpirit of Chryſt. Which dark miſtes the holy minds do alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Eſay. 6. Reue. 4.5.</note> &amp; giue glory to the bleſſed lamb, and ſo are ſaued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Eſai &amp; the Reuelation of Iohn. Contrarywiſe ſathan with the wicked confeſſeth them not, &amp; is damned, boſting his darkneſſe for light, &amp; the light of god to be darkneſſe: wherof both he him ſelf with his are accurſed. Eſa. <hi>5.</hi> Ioh. <hi>9.</hi> But dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a certaine voyde &amp; vaine thing of nature created, &amp; of the light natural: which thing (this paſſing from darkneſſe to light) that which is aboue declareth: which light is god him ſelfe. And further, the very heauens are not without their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, neither yet thoſe lights aboue, which we daily beholde: If not of nature, that muſt be brought to nought: yet of ſuche as muſte be renued into a more pure ſtate according to Eſai, Peter,<note place="margin">Eſay. 66. 2. Pet. 3. Reue. 21. Iob. 25.</note> and the Reue. And Iob likewiſe confeſſeth the very Moone and the Starres to be vncleane in Gods ſighte. Now if a man may finde in thoſe higher creatures their vanitie: how muche more vayne ſhall thoſe thinges be, which vnder the Sunne are ſubiect to perpetuall chaunces in this nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte worlde:<note place="margin">Reciprocis mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacionibus.</note> where all thinges grow and decreaſe agayne with mutuall chaunges, ſtande and fall, ryſe and decay? To theſe things therfore, Salomon here chiefly looketh, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treating of the vanitie of lyfe, of the thoughtes and ſtudies of mankinde, as they that are nexte to man, which he may looke vpon and conſider, and which aboue the reſte are more proue to féele ſinne. Wherfore, this worde vnder the ſunne, fell often from the king, béeing aſked his aduiſe (in this boke) of this worlde, things manyfeſtly falling to corruption, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Therefore, ſéeing that euery creature hath his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not onely in his dooing and operation, but alſo of hys moſte méere nature: wée are héere taught two things very neceſſarie to the comforting of our ſelues. One is, that God prouidently appoynteth the reconcinuation and reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things after the firſte workmanſhippe: by which,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26975:88"/> the thinges that were made by the ſpace of ſixe dayes, to the perfection which then was conuenient, both to their nature and dooings, ſhould be new wrought in this recreation to the beſt ſtate they might haue, and that in Chryſt, and through the reuelation of the ſonnes of God by the ſame. Further,<note place="margin">Roma. 8.</note> the condition of man is ſuche, that with him (if he be put in a vayne ſtate) all things lye ſubiect to vanitie. On the other ſide, he béeing reſtored to integritie and ſounde ſtate of the glory of God, all things are alſo deliuered from their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For man is (as it were) the knitting togither and head of all creatures: In whom all things, as members and partes, are compact to this perfection, which we ſée in them. For he hath his béeyng with all things: and to liue, he hath that propertie with rootes: he hath his ſenſe with beaſtes and liuyng wormes: he hathe power to vnderſtande the truthe and falſitie, good and euill with Aungelles, and with God himſelfe: wherevnto pertayneth this worde <hi>Microcoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> which is, little worlde, and this name of euery creature, to whom it is ſayde to be preached, when the worde of God is ſhewed to man: ſo great a worke of God is man. Hym the heauenly myndes doo ſerue, whoſe adminiſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites they be: heauen and earth, and all that is in them doth ſeruice vnto him. All things therefore pertaine to man,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.</note> as to their lord &amp; prince: euen ſo, vpon his ſtate dependeth both the vanitie &amp; health of al things. And ſo man, with the reſt of all creatures, are in ſundry wiſe vaine. For man is vaine as the whole and heade, and ſo chéefly vayne: but the reſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as partes included in man. For he comprehendeth all, and includeth all things, in béeing, lyfe, ſenſe and mynd. But the whole is here taken for that which conteineth perfection: not for that, either which is vniuerſal, called in latin <hi>integra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> ſubſtantial or predicatorie. Therfore the Apoſtle teacheth rightly: for we know that euery creature ſigheth with vs,<note place="margin">Roma. 8.</note> &amp; as it were traueleth togither with vs for childe, euen vntill this time. And alſo: for the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t expectation of the creature, looketh that the ſonnes of God be openly ſhewed. For the creature is ſubiect to vanitie againſt his wil, but for him that

Which how it ſhalbe brought to paſſe, it ſhall appeare hereafter. Wherefore the Scripture chiefly occupieth it ſelfe about man: it beateth properly about his fall and reſurrection: his ſinne and medicine to heale the ſame: his vanitie, and how his ſaluation ſhould be repaired. So that the Apoſtle graunteth to the Colloſſ. that when man is reconciled by the bloud of Ieſus Chryſt the heuenly Adam, all things are pacified by him, whether they be in heauen or in earth. And ſo the reparation of man is prouided: by which he and all things in him, might be reformed to the beſt ſtate. And this is it that we are héere warned of, by the vanitie of all things.</p>
            <p>The other thing that wée are héere taught in this place, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of the firſt: namely, that all Creatures are vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for a man, to put his confidence in any, and in which a man may aſcribe his ſaluation.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O note bréefly of vowes, it ſhall be méete for vs to begin at the definition. When we ſéeke therfore what a vow is, firſte offereth it ſelfe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is promiſſe. For they that make a vowe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe either them ſelues, or elſe their goodes. And for as much, as there be diuers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, by making a partition we ſhall ſée what a vow is in ſcripture. Promiſſe is in two ſortes. One is of men, and the other of God. That which is of men, is made at the arbitrement of men. Of which ſorte is that, which the Gentiles made to their gods, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the worde of God. As are alſo at this day, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes made &amp; vowed in monaſteries, which are made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doctrine of the goſpell. The other which is of God, is that, which is made according to the lawe of God. But euery ſuche promiſſe, is not properly called a vowe: for there be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine promiſſes in the lawe, which although they were made at will: yet coulde they not be omitted: as was the promiſſe, by which Iſraell tooke vppon him, to doe of his owne will, all the things that the lawe commaunded, according to the ſaying of Exodus:<note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> All things which the Lord hath ſpoken, will we do &amp; heare. This promiſſe did the manner of the couenant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to Iſraell, as in whoſe conditions it was expreſly put, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God woulde be the God of his people, if he woulde heare the words of the couenant,<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. Deut. 28.</note> and obey vnto the law. Le. 26. Deu. 28.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26975:90"/> Nowe, a vow is a voluntarie promiſſe, which is in a mannes choiſe to promiſſe or not to promiſſe withoute offence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this of Deutronomie: when thou voweſt a vow to the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not be ſlacke to pay it,<note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note> for the Lord thy God wil require it. And if thou deferre it, or ſlack the time to pay it, it ſhall be reckened to thée for ſinne. But if thou luſt not to promiſſe, thou ſhalt be without ſinne. But the matter was otherwiſe touching ſolempne oblations, or only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded for a time, according as euery mannes eſtimation was. Exod. 30. Such oblations were voluntarie,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> yet they were no vowes. Therefore, we muſt ſéeke a difference, by which a vow may be ſundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from other oblations. And that differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhall be made with a diffinition. A vowe is a voluntarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, made after the example and forme of the lawe, which is put in the power to vowe it or not to vowe it,<note place="margin">Numer. 6. Leuit. 27.</note> as was the law of the Nazarites, and alſo the vowe of the ſoule, of which we reade in Leuit. 27. But in this vowe were two things regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. One principall, which was chéefely acceptable to God: namely, an harte prone and inclined by feare to the glory of God: which hart, the law required before al things. The other not principall, which is the externe oblation, being but myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and figuratiue, which was deſtinate to a certaine ende, that is to wit, to the kingdome of Chriſt, in which it ſhould be finiſhed: that is, fulfilled ſpiritually, according to this ſaying of the Apoſtle: Theſe things are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhadow of things to come:<note place="margin">Colloſ. 2.</note> but the body is in Chriſt. Therfore, as pertaining to this part of vowes, a diſtinction héere offereth it ſelfe againe, that thou put one vowe of the law, and an other of the goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Nota.</note> This to be true, &amp; the other myſtical the firſt, Moſes teacheth the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the apoſtle cloſely toucheth to the Romanes when he ſayeth:<note place="margin">Roma. 6.</note> Therefore are we buried togither with him by Baptiſme vnto death, that as Chriſte was rayſed vp from the deade, by the glory of the Father: euen ſo we alſo walke in neweneſſe of life. Thys is the true Vowe, thys is the true Conſecration of the godly, by the whiche the Sainctes bynde them ſelues to God, that they will walke in a newe life, laying a ſide the olde, by the light of the ſpirite of Chriſte,
<pb facs="tcp:26975:91"/> being forebrought vnto them: not by their owne power, but by the power of God: by which they are newe borne to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of theſe deſires in them ſelues: and by which they are thus brought, to offer them ſelues vnto God. In which power of regeneration, who ſo be therein, it is as frée to them bothe to thinke well, and to doe well, as it is to beaſtes to goe by the vitall breath of naturall life, or as it is to birdes to flie abrode vnder the ſkie. Which vowe of the newe lawe, the godly did prefigure in the olde couenaunt by externe oblations: as did the Nazarites by the regal buſhe of their heades, by the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of deade corpſes, and by abſtaining from wine. And this performed they, according to the meaſure of the ſpirit of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode. So that, there is one and an eſpeciall vowe, euen as there is one kingdome of God, one and principall couenante, one Prieſthoode, which is annoynted with the ſpirit (that oile of heauen) one ſacrifice, &amp; one heauenly inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time. Beſides all theſe true and principall things, the people that were vnder the lawe, prefigured myſticall vowes and ſacrifices: a myſtical couenaunt alſo ſhewed in the fleſhe, and deputed to an earthly inheritaunce: and a myſticall kingdome likewiſe &amp; Prieſthoode, vntil the fulneſſe of times. Of which things,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> the Apoſtle ſayeth to the Hebrues.

Thou ſegregateſt a certaine kinds of meate and drinke to thy ſelfe: but the Goſpell ſegregateth none. Thou iudgeſt thy ſelfe in meat and drinke, contrary to that which the Apoſtle biddeth, which ſaith:<note place="margin">Colloſ. 2.</note> Let no man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudge you in meat and drinke. Thou maiſt ſay: If there be none obligation of vowe, iudgement hathe no place. But thou naughtily voweſt: and by thy vowe ſeparateſt the vſe of meate, which Chriſt maketh frée to thée: to whoſe féete, and to the feete of his members, all things are ſubiecte by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, according to Geneſis, and to the Pſalme. The Apoſtle ſharply inueying againſt you,<note place="margin">Gene. 1. Pſalm. 8. 1. Timo. 4.</note> calleth you falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which commaundeth to abſtaine from meates, which God hathe created to be receiued with thankes giuing of the faithfull. Thou furthermore voweſt to liue vnmarried, being vncertaine with thy ſelfe of the gifte of chaſtitie, or what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe it will haue with thée: which is not mannes gifte, nor at our owne arbitrement, but the méere gift of God: namely, to be obtained by prayer at the will of the giuer, &amp; of none other mannes power, according to this ſaying: All are not able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend this ſaying, but they to whome it is giuen.<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou canſte be continent or chaſte, thou art continent by the benefite of God, and not by thine owne. Therefore,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. Leui. 27. Numeri. 6.</note> be thou chaſte, fréely, according to the frée ſpirit of Chriſt, which inſpireth heauenly giftes where he wil. In which libertie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the conſideration of vowes is put. Thoſe things that were moſte fréely vowed in the lawe, were not perpetuall: but all ſuche, as might be redéemed when they luſted. But ye vowe vowes without the woorde of God: and not contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yée promiſſe the ſame to be perpetuall, both without the lawe, and without examples of Gods law. But if thou be not able to liue chaſte, ſtudie that thou doe no violence by thy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes to this woorde of creation ſowne in nature: It is not good for man to be alone. And alſo to this: It is better to marrie
<pb facs="tcp:26975:92"/> than to burne.<note place="margin">Gene. 2. 2. Corin. 7.</note> But thou ſhalt not bring it to paſſe: the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie and weakeneſſe of the fleſhe declareth that plainely, which thou alwayes ouercommeſt not, endeuor thy ſelf ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto neuer ſo much by the feare of God: which feare we deny not to be in ſome of them, whom this lacke of knowledge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and holdeth captiue to make vowes: partly by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate deſire of ſome men, which can by no coloure be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or that I ſpeake not of more greuous things: for my mind is (before God) to couet the winning of many to Chriſte by wryting this, and not to hurt by my wil any man. Therfore, as in the lawe were vowed myſticall vowes, after the rule of Gods lawe, and not raſhly all things what ſo euer they were, and after euery ſort, and in euery place, according to Deutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie and Leuiticus:<note place="margin">Deut. 12. Leui. 27.</note> euen ſo, in the ſtate of the goſpel, vowes ought to be enformed after the example and diſpoſition of the heauenly woord, frée from al externe habite or ſhape of things vnder the ſunne: which vowes, the faith of regeneration may inwardly gouerne, and not thine owne preſumption, guided without the woorde of God. And let them be ſuche vowes, as may chaunge the affections, which may guid conſciences (and not bring an externe viſure) well anſwering before God, but not apparel, not meat, not ſhauing of heads, not oyles, halles, golde, and ſtones. Al which, by the very abuſe of an euil hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led conſcience, and with this vaine world, waxe olde, vaniſhe away and come to naught. Therefore, as Salomon ſayeth, a man muſt vow and pay his vow: But in ſuch order, that thou bothe vowe and paie, after the preſcript of Gods woorde heard in the Temple, and not after the doctrines of men: which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, God ſpeaketh not by his Prophets: for ſuche in déede is the condition and ſtate of man, that he only depende vppon the worde of the liuing God his maker: that he neither adde nor take away from it,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> according to Deutronomie. For, as in this viſible world, that heauenly moouing is a conſtante and firme rule into all times, of all mutations, which chaunce in theſe lowe things: and as ſome knowne and certaine quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, meaſureth the other quantities of vncertaine greatneſſe: and as in the very mindes that are made the generall antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26975:92"/> and principall guides, meaſure (like faithfull rules) the other cogitations: euen ſo, the only woorde of God, is farre the moſt conſtant meaſure, rule, &amp; ſure knowledge, by which, thou maiſt direct thine own conſcience in thoſe things, which pertaine to eternall life. So that, as men (from rules) neither adde nor diminiſhe, leaſt they may deceiue a man like <hi>Lesbies</hi> rules: euen ſo, by Moſes, ought nothing to be either added or diminiſhed, from the inflexible woord of God: which thing let them likewiſe obſerue, whome mennes decrées holde yet as captiue. If therfore thou makeſt a vow, and haſt not the word of God to lead thee to the ſame, binding thy conſcience where it ought to be frée: making a lawe to thy ſelfe, where as is no lawe of God: appointing an obſeruation of creatures, where as the kingdom of Chriſt admitteth none: (who is that king of heauen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge ſitting vpon the throne of God the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whome, men ought to be well ware and do reuerently:) that vowe of thine, which thou thus makeſt, dwelling ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vppon the earth, ſhall be none: voide is it therefore, and friuolous, and ought not in any wiſe to be fulfilled, but to be broken of thée. Thus farre of the vowes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men and prieſtes, touching their diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of apparell, and the ſhauing of their heades, with ſuch other vaine vowes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances.</p>

            <p n="66">66 Which places are truely to be vnderſtanded, as the new borne are truely called the children of god. For as there is a true regeneration: euen ſo, there is a true participation and poſſeſſion of the diuine nature, and of the diuine lighte, wiſedome, and rightuouſneſſe. This is our hope and vocation in Chriſt the head, of the participation of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, and of the nature of the father, by that we be borne a newe of the ſpirite of Chriſt.

            <p n="67">67 But we ſpeake héere of Chriſte, as the treating of him pertaineth to the cauſe of regeneration, which commeth of the ſpirite. For what the ſcripture ſpeaketh of the eternall word, we holily woorſhip, and will ſpeake thereof in an other place.</p>
            <p n="68">68 Therfore we be not called the ſonnes of God, &amp; newe men after the ſame ſort that Chriſt is: For he is the naturall ſonne of God, and the newe man bothe within and wythout. But we be the ſonnes of God by adoption, and new men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inwardly in this world.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 50.</note> He is borne the ſonne of God, and the newe man. We are begotten the children of death and of ſinne by the firſt Adam: and we are borne the ſonnes of God and a newe creature by the ſecond Adam. For of the earth we be earthie: and in Chriſt the heauenly man, we are taken to grace, and to the enheritance of ſonnes, by newe birth, which ſhall in the day of reſurrection put on newe fleſhe vppon vs, euen of the fleſhe of Chriſte.</p>
            <p n="69">69 So that, héer being renued while we liue in this world we conſiſt of two men: of an outwarde and inwarde man, of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26975:99"/> body corrupted with concupiſcence: and of a minde repaired with the ſpirite of the newe couenaunt.</p>
            <p n="70">70 The body once corrupted, is not reſtored in this world: for it is all earthie, tending to the earth of his owne will and waight. And therefore he alſo returneth vnto it, bicauſe of the ſentence once giuen vppon it,<note place="margin">Gene. 3. Colloſ. 3. 2. Corin. 4.

            <p n="71">71 The inner man therefore, that is, the minde,<note place="margin">Colloſ. 3.</note> which is put into this body to rule it, is only renued in this life, to the felowſhip of the diuine light.</p>
            <p n="72">72 Wherefore, they that be regenerate in this fraile life, cary men about with them, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the one to the other, as are light and darkeneſſe, death and life: and as farre diſſident, as heauen and earth. The outwarde and olde man is viſible: the inward and new man is inuiſible. The outwarde man is earthly, and the inwarde man is heauenly. The outward man is conceiued of carnal ſeede, and the inward man is ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſpiritual ſéede of the word of the liuing god. The outward man is fed with meats y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will periſh: but the inward man groweth with eternal foode.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> The one is made fleſh of the fleſh of man: the other is made a ſpirit of the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p n="73">73 The outwarde man is euer polluted and ſinneth: but the inward and new man neuer: neither cannot it ſinne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11. 1. Iohn. 3.</note> as it cannot die.</p>
            <p n="74">74 And no maruel, for as much as thou ſhalt finde contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawes in them. The one of ſinne, which holdeth vs downe to the ground, perſuading earthy and carnal deſires: the other calleth vs vpwarde, burning in deſires of heauenly things: where, a man may ſée the maruellous coniunction of bothe men, ſet together for experience of ſo great things, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the maruellous councels of the diuine prouidence.</p>
            <p n="75">75 Further, the olde man is created of God, and therefore made of nothing: the newe man is borne of God, &amp; ſo of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: namely, of his ſpirite. Wherof he neuer dieth, he neuer
<pb facs="tcp:26975:100"/> waxeth olde. And theſe are the things, which Chriſt diſputeth of the life eternal: which, true faith bringeth: that is to ſay, the ſpirit of Gods light. Vppon this poynt, ſtandeth the hope and conſolation of Sainctes.</p>
            <p n="76">76 By this faith, the outwarde man obtaineth pardone, if the ſpirite of the inwarde man remurmur againſt him, while we dwel in this life.<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.

For it is not obtained, that they haue no being in vs, and that they wholely be deſtroyed in this worlde, as long as this fleſh liueth: the reſurrection giueth that: in which both the body it ſelfe ſhall be alſo raiſed vp out of the duſte of the earth, from deathe vnto life, to fulfill the body of Chriſte: which, as the head to the body went before, being the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne of the newe creature, and the vnſpotted firſte frutes of the kingdome of the fathers maieſtie.</p>
            <p n="77">77 For what life ſhal the head haue without the body, or the body without the members?</p>
            <p n="78">78 And the fall of the firſt man ſo repaired and amended, we ſhal be reſtored to that from whence we fel: that is to wit, to rightuouſneſſe and innocencie: but in a far better ſtate and condition: for in this innocencie, the earthy life ſhal be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged for an heauenly: mortalitie for immortalitie: and after ſinne, fall ſhall be changed for reſurrection: and the ignomie of the croſſe, for glory.

            <p n="79">79 Not only the olde man, but alſo euery other creature ſhall be redéemed and deliuered from vanitie, vnder the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſo great a kingdom, the Apoſtle witneſſeth. Rom. 8.</p>
            <p n="80">80 But how? Shall the plants reuiue againe and floriſhe a newe?

Where is diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be marked, that we diſtinct theſe thrée dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in Chriſt: namely, a true fleſhe, and very bones, a very ſoule and minde in déede, and the very ſpirite of his father: In ſuch ſorte, that of euery one of theſe, the nature be ſeperately &amp; diſtinctly kept, and reſerued to it ſelfe in the kingdom of glory: not one mixed with an other, euen as Chriſt himſelfe did diſtinct them:<note place="margin">The diſtincte nature in Chriſt reſerued after he was glorified.</note> when after the reſurrection he proued and verified to be in him the nature of very fleſh and bones.

Which thing, if it ſhalbe marked, we ſhal ouercome great difficulties, and ſhall eſcape moſt gréeuous errors, that are now in theſe dayes of the fleſh of Chriſt. Therefore, as by this Chriſt, all things were made, both viſible and inuiſible: euen ſo, by the ſame, and in the ſame, all things ſhall be renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to glory, the woorke of reſtauration, ſo farre paſſing the firſt woorke of creation, as mutable is excelled of immutable: and as that which is renuable, is excelled and ſurmounted of that, which already is renued to better, and into the beſt ſtate it may haue.</p>
            <p n="82">82 This is the merite of the pure bloud of Chriſte Ieſus the heauenly man: which being ſprinkled abrode vppon all things, mundifieth, that is, maketh cleane al things in heauen and in earth, the oldneſſe of corruption diſſolued, &amp; the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of incorruptibilitie brought in that ſhall abide for euer: when this ſhalbe ſpoken: Stabilitie of ſtableneſſe, &amp; al things are ſtable, as hitherto hath bene ſaid: vanitie of vanities, &amp; all things are vanitie, while the vanitie of the olde creature raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

As in déede I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend none other end, but in folowing ſtil that, which you haue already begun: you might therein continue, and ſéeke the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of his glory more and more, vntill the time yée haue eſtabliſhed his kingdome and raigne in ſuche perfection, as it may rightly be knowne vnto the world.

And for as muche, as you refuſe not to be taughte of the ſame maiſter whome I ſerue, but that you rather preferre (to all the reſt) the grace that he hathe giuen vnto you, to be one of hys Diſciples:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26975:101"/> I thinke that I haue no néede to make vnto you any long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or preface: bicauſe I finde you ſufficiently diſpoſed to receiue all ſuche things as ſhall procéede of him.

But in the meane time, bicauſe that Sathan ceaſſeth not to rayſe vp (by all meanes poſſible) new combates:<note place="margin">Sathans dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> and that it is a thing of it ſelfe ſo harde, that there can be nothing more harde, than to cauſe, that the worde of God may pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably rule amongeſt the people: which, through the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne natures, be giuen to lyes and fantaſies: And foraſmuche as there are ſo many circumſtances, which impecheth (in theſe dayes) the ſtrayght courſe of the ſame: and aboue all, that the ſuperſtitions of Antichryſt, hauing taken roote ſo long time,<note place="margin">Antechriſtes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticions.</note> may not eaſily be taken away from their hartes. It ſéemeth vnto me, yée haue great néede to be confirmed and ſtrengthned, by ſome holy exhortations: and I doubt not, but the experience therof teacheth you to féele the ſame, whiche ſhall be the cauſe to make me procéede more frankly, conſidering that my purpoſe (as I beléeue) ſhall be conformable to your deſire. And albeit that mine exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be ſuperfluous, yet I am ſure, that you wil beare with that good zeale &amp; affection of mine, which (vndoubtedly) ſtirreth me to doo it. Wherfore, I thinke (according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) that the neceſſitie which ye féele, ſhall cauſe mine exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations a great deale the ſonner and the better to be receiued, whatſoeuer they ſhal be. I beſéech your Lordſhip, that it may

            <p>I doubte not, but that the greate troubles, whiche (not long ſince) happened vnto you, hathe béene very harde and noyſome: and moſte of all, for that many might haue taken occaſion of ſlaunder, foraſmuche as they were moued, in ſome parte vnder the ſhadowe of chaunging the Religion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can not bée, but it hathe béene vnto you a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and harde aſſaulte: as well for the cares whiche myghte come vnto you, as for the mutinies of the maligne and wicked ignoraunt people, and alſo for the feare, great daunger, and trouble, ſpecially of the Prince, and of all the whole companie of the honeſt and godly. Truely the brute that I haue heard a farre off, hathe cauſed mée to haue in myne hearte no ſmall gréefe, vntill ſuche time as I had after knowledge, that God had begunne to put foorth ſome remedie. Neuertheleſſe, conſidering that they be not yet all pacifyed and quiet, and that the Diuell may yet renue them agayne: yée ſhall remember that which the holy Hyſtorie reciteth of the good king Ezechias:<note place="margin">Troubles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of wicked religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that is to ſay, when he had abolyſhed the ſuperſtitions in Iewry, and refourmed the ſtate of the Churche, according to the lawe of God: that then he was ſo oppreſſed of hys enemies, that he was lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a very loſte and deſperate man.</p>
            <p>It is not without great cauſe (O noble Prince) that the holy ſpirite of God ſo notably expreſſeth, that ſuche affliction happened vnto him, immediately after he had eſtabliſhed the true Religion in his perfecte and due order: for it was very likely, that aſſoone as he went about to ſet foorthe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, he ſhould not haue his Realme long quiete: ſo all faythfull Rulers, Princes, and gouernours of Countreis and common wealthes, be aduertiſed truely by this example,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26975:102"/> that the more they ſhall employ and endeuour their labours to clenſe their Countreis, and to put out all Idolatries, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne fantaſies, and vayne ſuperſtitions,<note place="margin">Princes, and all chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, that ſeeke truly the worſhipping of God, ſhall haue their faith tried with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their truth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.</note> and procure that God be truely worſhipped (in déede) as he ought: the more ſhall their fayth then be proued and tryed, with the fyre of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers temptations, euen as golde is tryed in the furnace.

In the meane tyme the Diuell dothe alſo his office, entending by all couert and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meane, to deſtroy the good and holeſome doctrine, bicauſe he can not openly attayne to his moſt curſed &amp; lothſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

This thing conſidered, and foraſmuch as the hand of God is not ſhorter than it was, &amp; that he hath at this day in ſo great recommendation the defence of his people, his truth &amp; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as euer he had,<note place="margin">God ioineth with princes to helpe them in his owne cauſe at all times and in al temptations.</note> doubt not (my Lord) but that he wil helpe you: and not onely for one time, or for one quarell, but at all times, and in as many temptations as he ſhall ſende vnto you: yea if the moſt part of the worlde ſhall reſiſte the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and enforce them ſelues with all rage and violence, to impech &amp; hinder the ſetting foorth therof.

It is then no new thing, if there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, when the godly Rulers and miniſters goeth about to bring them to the pure and perfecte obedience of God.

And that we be aduertiſed, to bring to this ende, all that is ſaide and done in the churche: that is: being retired from this ſinnefull world, and other our deadly aduerſaries, we may be lifted vp to heauen with Chriſt our head, our Lord, and ſauioure. Wherefore then, ſéeing that God hath wrought in you and giuen you the grace, to reſtore againe the knowledge of this moſte ſounde and holy doctrine, which hath bene ſo long time buryed by curſſed Antichriſte: I leaue to kéepe you with longer purpoſe: and that which I haue touched of the manner of teaching, is only, for that the people may be rightly inſtructed, and to féele that which the Apoſtle ſayth, that is that the woorde of God is a ſworde, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with two edges, piercing the thoughts &amp; affections,<note place="margin">A fault moſt happily now reformed, through the mightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and great mercy of God.</note> euen vnto the marowe of the bone. I ſay this (my Lord) for that I thinke there is very few liuely preachings in the realme: but rather that the moſte part reciteth them, as it were by lector.

               </gap>rſt yée haue not commonly (as I thinke) your Paſtors ſo good and apte, as you would lawfully wiſhe and
<pb facs="tcp:26975:106"/> deſire: wherfore, it is néedefull for you, to ſéeke diligently, and to ſupplie that lacke. Secondly, there might chance to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light ſpirites, which would (peraduenture) leape beyonde their boundes: ſowing corrupted and fooliſhe fantaſies, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they doe in newe things. But all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impéecheth not, but that the ordinaunce of Ieſus Chriſte ought to haue his courſe, as in preaching the goſpell. Nowe this preaching oughte not to be deade, but quicke and liuely, bothe for to teache, exhorte, and to reprehende (as S. Paule ſaith to Timothe) in ſuche ſorte, as if any infidell do enter, he may be wounded, ouercome, and taken (as he ſaith in another place) to giue glory and praiſe to God. You knowe alſo (my Lord) how that he ſpeaketh of the liuelyneſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ought to be in the mouthes of them, which would approue them ſelues, good and faithfull miniſters of the Goſpell of Chriſte: that they ought not to haue or vſe woordes of Rethoricke or muche cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, entending therby to be in the greater eſtimation: but that the ſpirite of God oughte to ſounde in their voyces,<note place="margin">Curioſitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly in the doctrine of the goſpell.</note> for to woorke in power and vertue. All the daungers that are to be feared of men, ought not (with humaine policies) ſo appeare, at any time or in any place, that thereby the ſpirite of God be impeached or let to haue his libertie and due courſe in them: in whome he hath ſo plentifully diſtributed of his graces, for the edifying of the church of God. It is true, that in the meane time, nothing were better nor more expedient, than to ſtoppe the lightneſſe of fantaſticall ſpirites, which taketh ouer much licence. Alſo to ſhutte and cloſe faſt, the gates of all curioſities and newe wicked doctrines.</p>
            <p>But the beſt and moſte conuenient meane ſhall be, ſuch as God him ſelfe hath appoynted and ſhewed vnto vs: that firſt, bicauſe there be ſome reſolute of the doctrine,<note place="margin">An oth moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and to be offered to the miniſters of Gods word and why.</note> that all oughte to preache: the which all Prelates and Curates ſhould ſweare to folow: that none be receiued into any Eccleſiaſtical charge, onleſſe he promiſſe to obſerue the ſame true concorde and vnion.</p>
            <p>After that, to haue a formall and common inſtruction, for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26975:106"/> to inſtructe the yong children and the ignorante people, which ſhould make them acquainted with the true Doctrine, in ſuch wiſe, that they may diſcerne it from lies and corruptions, which elſe might be brought in.</p>
            <p>To the contrary, beléeue me (my Lord) that the Churche of God ſhall be neuer well conſerued without Cathechiſme:<note place="margin">Cathechiſme.</note> For it is as the ſéede to be kept, that the good graine periſheth not, but that it may growe and encreaſe from age to age.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if your grace deſire to builde a woorke long to endure, which ſhoulde not ſhortly be in decaie: cauſe that the children in their yonge age, be inſtructed with a good Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, that may learne them bréefely, and according to their ſmall capacitie, to knowe wherein conſiſteth the true chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or moſt perfect religion of Chriſte.</p>
            <p>This Cathechiſme ſhall ſerue for two purpoſes: that is to ſay: for an introduction to all people, to profitte well in that,<note place="margin">Cathechiſm for two p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the meane time, I ſay not, but that it is good and alſo neceſſarie, to binde and reſtraine the Paſtoures and Curates,<note place="margin">Neceſsitie to binde paſtors and curats.</note> to a certaine order and forme wrytten, for to ſupplie the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce and ſimpleneſſe of ſome of them: and for to ſhew the better conformitie and concorde with all Churches.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for to bridle and ouerthrowe, all vaine curioſitie and newe inuentions of ſuch, as deſireth nothing but to runne riotte, the ſayd Cathechiſme (as I haue before rehearſed) ſhal ſerue and be a good bridell for ſuche folkes: And alſo in ſuche ſorte and order, are the miniſtring of the holy Sacramentes, to be giuen, and in like manner the publike Prayers.</p>
            <p>And in the meane ſeaſon, your grace muſte take héede to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide ſuche pollicies, as may deſtroy the ſtrength and vertue, that oughte to be in the preaching of the Goſpell: and that you employ your laboure and diligence, as muche as yée can poſſible, that there be liuely and good Trumpettes, whoſe ſounde may enter into the déepeneſſe of their hartes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:26975:107"/>
            <p>For there is danger and great doutfulneſſe, that yée ſhall not ſée great profit of ſuch reformation (howe great &amp; holy ſo euer it be) vnleſſe, euen at once with it, the power and vertue of good preaching, be diſplayed and ſet foorthe togither. It is not without cauſe which is ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhal ſtrike the earth by the ſcepter of his mouthe, and ſhall deſtroy the euill by the ſpirite of his lips. It is Gods diſpoſed good way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will ouerthrowe vs, in deſtroying all that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte him. And for that cauſe, the goſpell is alſo called, the power,<note place="margin">Princes and paſtors both mainteiners of the chriſtian ſtate.</note> the raigne, or kingdome of God. And notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the ordinances and ſtatues of Princes, be good helpes to aduance and maintaine the ſtate of chriſtianitie: yet will God haue his ſoueraigne vertue declared, in the ſpirituall ſwoorde of his woorde, which is ſet foorthe by his appoynted paſtoures. And to the ende, I will not long trouble your Lordſhip, I wil come to the ſecond point, that I haue purpoſed to ſhewe vnto you. Which is, to aboliſhe and take cleane away, the abuſes and corruptions, that Sathan héeretofore hath mingled with the ordinance of God. We know, that vnder the Pope, there is a baſtarde chriſtianitie,<note place="margin">A Baſtarde chriſtianitie.</note> that God ſhall diſalowe at the laſte day: for as muche, as at this day, he hath condemned it by his woorde. If we deſire to flée backe and retire from the worlde, and from ſuche approued perdition, there is nothing better, than to folowe the example of S. Paule: the which, willing to correcte the euill that the Corrinthians had ioyned to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, ſaid vnto them: I haue receiued of the Lorde, that, which I haue giuen vnto you. Of that we muſt al gather one generall inſtruction: that is: to returne to the righte and naturall commaundement of God,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the Goſpells in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection.</note> if we will haue a good and an approued reformation of him. For as many minglings as men hathe aduaunced of their owne wicked inuentions: ſo many infections be there,<note place="margin">Half cropping of rotten abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh chriſtianitie mixed and counterſect.</note> throughe the which we are turned from the holy vſage of that, which God hathe giuen vnto vs for our ſauing health. Therfore to fall to cropping, or cutting off but only half the branches of ſuch rotten abuſes, it cannot bring again the good things into their perfect &amp; pure eſtate, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that we ſhall then haue amongſt vs, a chriſtianitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:26975:107"/> mixed and counterfayte. I ſay thys, bicauſe that ſome (vnder the colour of moderation) be of opinion to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many abuſes in the Churche,<note place="margin">Moderation.</note> without taking them cleane away: and they thinke that it is inough to haue taken oute the roote onely of the principall abuſes.

On the other ſide wée ſée, that although men bée ſufficiently warned of their faultes and erroures, and bée aduertiſed of them as muche as is poſſible, yet neuertheleſſe they bée ſo hardened, that no man can attayne to their good and perfect ende. Then, if there ſhall bée lefte vnto them ſome Reliques or fonde fantaſies to remayne,<note place="margin">The hurt that enſueth by the remnaunt of Popiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques left in the church.</note> it ſhall bée a nouriſhemente in déede of muche more contempte and greater obſtinacie, and a couerture to darken and hyde all doctrine that may bée proponed vnto them.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, that as it is conuenient to obſerue ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and that too greate extremitie is not good nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:<note place="margin">Ceremonies.</note> ſo likewiſe it is not vnſéemely to vſe the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies according to the time and groſneſſe of the people: but it may not be, that any thing which is of Sathan and of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryſt, ſhould once paſſe vnder any ſuch colour. For that cauſe the holy Scripture commendeth thoſe good kinges, which did

Wherefore, my Lorde, ſéeing that God hathe hitherto preſerued you, rayſed you vp to honoure, and hathe broughte you now ſo farre forwardes in his workes, I pray you goe on, and continue your dooing without any exception, to the ende he may approue you his diligente ouerſéer and ſetter foorth of his temple, in ſuche wiſe that the time of the king your Nephew may be compared vnto the time of Ioſias: and that you ſhall put all things in ſuch good eſtate, as there ſhall remaine nothing to him but to maintaine the good eſtabliſhed order which God ſhall haue prepared vnto him by your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meane.<note place="margin">Dregges of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie.</note> I will alleage vnto you an example of ſuche dregges, that may peraduenture reſte to be a little leauen, which in the ende will make the paaſte ſowre. They vſe in your Countrey of Englande ſome kinde of prayer for the dead when the Communion is receiued. I know well that it is not to aduouch the Purgatorie of the Pope: I know alſo that it may be alleaged by auncient cuſtome to doo ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce for the dead, to the ende to ioyne togither all the members of the body. But there is an apparentorie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumente to the contrarie, that the Supper of Ieſus Chryſt is ſo holy a thing, that it ought not to be defiled by no inuention of man.<note place="margin">Prayer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſcripture.</note> Moreouer, that in praying to God we oughte not let ſlippe the bridle to our owne fantaſticall deuotions, but to kéepe the rule that S.
